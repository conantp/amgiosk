# jQuery HSL Color Picker

A css and javascript driven HSL picker. Made to be small, styleable and easy to use.

Example
-----------
```
$('input[type="color"]').hslPicker({
    color: 'orange'
});
```
Config
-----------
#### `color` : string
A hex string (e.g. '#ff0000') or [named color](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-color/#named-colors) to set the initial
color. If no initial color is defined, the value of the input will be used. If no color is associated with the picker or 'random' is passed as a color, the picker will select a random color.

#### `hsl` : array|object
Define an hsl color as `[0, 0.25, 0.5]` or `[ h: 0, s: 0.25: l: 0.5 ]` with percentages as the values. If this color is defined, it will override the `color` configuration.

#### `disabled` : bool
Whether to disable the picker. Initializing with a disabled input will also disable the picker. Disabling the picker overrides disabled inputs.

#### `disableInputs` : string|array|object
Prevent specific values from being changed. Passing 'h' would disable the hue; 'hs' would prevent hue and saturation. Can be passed as `'h'`, `['h']`, or `{ h: true }`.

#### `alwaysOpen` : bool
Whether to keep the picker modal always open.

Methods
-----------
The picker instance can be retrieved by passing 'picker':
```
var picker = $('input').hslPicker('picker');
```
#### `.disable()`
---
Disable the picker. Disabling the picker overrides disabled inputs. Can also be triggered via the input.
```
$('input').trigger('disable');
```

#### `.enable()`
---
Enable the picker. Enabling the picker overrides disabled inputs. Can also be triggered via the input.
```
$('input').trigger('enable');
```

#### `.disableInput(opts)`
---
Disable specific values from being changed.

#### `.enableInputs(opts)`
---
Enable specific values to be changed.

#### `.refresh()`
---
Refresh the picker with the current hsl value on the picker instance. Use this if the hsl values have been changed manually:
```
var picker = $('input').hslPicker('picker');
picker.h = 0.5;
picker.refresh();
```
 Can also be triggered via the input.
```
$('input').trigger('refresh');
```

#### `.open()`
---
Open the picker. Can also be triggered via the input.
```
$('input').trigger('open');
```

#### `.close()`
---
Close the picker. Can also be triggered via the input.
```
$('input').trigger('close');
```
#### `.update()`
---
Update the value of the color picker. Can be passed a valid color or hsl value. The picker can also be updated by updating the input:
```
$('input').trigger('update', { color: '#000000' });
```

#### `.val()`
---
Set or retrieve the hex value of the picker.

#### `.destroy()`
---
Destroy the picker. This will remove all bindings and inputs generated by the picker. Can also be triggered by passing 'destroy' or triggering the input:
```
$('input').hslPicker('destroy');
// or
$('input').trigger('destroy');
```

Extending
-----------
`$.hslPicker` is the picker object that can be extened. `$.hslPicker` also contains helpful color manipulation methods:
* `.hslToRgb(h, s, l)`
* `.rgbToHsl(r, g, b)`
* `.hexToRgb(hex)`
* `.rgbToHex(r, g, b)`
* `.hexToHsl(hex)`
* `.random()`

Styles
----------------
Include the `jquery.hsl-picker.css` file. The styles rely on the border-box model which is used by [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) by default:
```
* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

Support
----------------

Modern browsers and IE9+
