Their music combines elements of old country, rock-a-billy, bluegrass, gospel, and even a little touch of classic rock \u2018n roll. Lisa Love of Georgia Music Magazine and the Georgia Music Foundation describes the band by saying, \u201cWhen you have a group of women who are natural story-tellers, who sooth their aggressive musical chops with beautiful harmonies, temper their rock-n-roll sensibilities with an understanding of Appalachian tradition, and come off as a little bit Keith Richards, a little bit Bill Monroe, you get Roxie Watson.\u201d The group formed in 2007 as a just-for-kicks opportunity for long time friends Beth Wheeler, Lenny Lasater, Linda Bolley, Sonia Tetlow and Becky Shaw to get together and play songs they loved. But what started out as just porch settin\u2019 and cover song playing evolved organically over the years, through the word-of-mouth support of an ever-growing group of loyal fans, into one of the finest original bands in the Southeast, regularly selling out storied songwriting venues from Eddie\u2019s Attic in Decatur, GA to the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, TN. Each band member takes turns with the lead vocal and contributes to both song and arrangement ideas. From the firecracker guitar playing of Bolley to the delicate mandolin of Wheeler, the propulsive bass of Lasater to the banjo poetry of Tetlow, the lap steel and button box swells to the harp and guitar rhythms of Shaw, Roxie Watson weaves a rich sound. Georgianne Nienaber of the Huffington Post summed up the essence of Roxie Watson when she wrote, \u201cThese women are more than proficient as musicians, have a warm way with a story, and a natural stage banter that comes from a long history of friendship and community. The stage morphs into a back porch, with the audience becoming honored guests in an intimate setting that is a heck of a lot of fun, heartwarming, and heart-rending when it needs to be.\u201d</p>\n"},{"node_title":"The Grey Eagle Presents: Driftwood w/SPECIAL GUESTS \u2013 [rock n\u2019 roll] w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/wXdDXOeceBqeaXWDI5KJudkYD4aCBSDR7349-pYXFeI/mtime:1428511879/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Driftwood.jpg?itok=r5PZMUHg\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24244","path":"/show/grey-eagle-presents-driftwood-wspecial-guests-%E2%80%93-rock-n%E2%80%99-roll-w-contact-us-0","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Saturday June 13th, 2015 : 7pm | : 8pm : rock n\u2019 roll : All Ages : mix of seats and standing $8 adv. / $10 d.o.s. : The energy of rock n\u2019 roll is impossible to categorize \u2013 mercurial, specific to its beholder and profoundly reflective.

For almost 30 years Russ has worked as a professional musician and has made a name for himself playing many different styles of music including Rock &amp; Roll, Country, Gospel, Blues, R&amp;B, Dixieland, Big Band Swing, Bebop, pit work for Broadway style shows and Symphonic music. Of all these Jazz remains his first true love. He\u2019s had the gracious opportunity to share the stage with quite a few famous musicians during that time. For example: Jimmy Thackery (The Nighthawks and The Drivers) Kim Wilson (Fabulous Thunderbirds) Mookie Brill (world renown singer and musician) Hubert Sumlin (Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s guitarist for 25 years) Chicago Bob Nelson (The Heartfixers) Jerry \u201cBoogie\u201d McCain (She\u2019s Tough!)

Since 1989 Russ has played drums and vocalized on 31 albums ~ 8 of those being his own projects. After touring and traveling for many years playing with various blues bands Russ decided to start one of his own. With the help of his good friend and guitarist Marc Brookshire they formed THE MIGHTY MIGHTY MEN in 2001. In late 2003 he started his second musical organization called THE NOUVEAU-PASSE ORCHESTRA playing the music that he grew up listening to, vintage jazz and dance band music of the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s. The orchestra ranges in size from 14 pieces to a 35 piece concert orchestra. Then, if that weren\u2019t enough, he formed a smaller version of the NPO called THE RUSS WILSON SWINGTETTE. He is also co-leader of a quartet called THE SWINGTONES and, most recently, has started a new band playing Rockabilly and Honky Tonk Country called THE ASHEVEGAS PLAYBOYS and if THAT weren\u2019t enough he is also percussionist/vocalist for the Hawaiian/Exotica group called KON TIKI, WENDY HAYES, HEATHER MASTERTON and the world renown FIRECRACKER JAZZ BAND. Somehow he still finds time to freelance for such luminaries as guitarists ARMAND LENCHEK and WILL McFARLAND and swing band leader GEORGE KNOTT and THE ATOMIC RHYTHM ALLSTARS. In 2007 Russ made his premier as conductor with his orchestra performing George Gershwin\u2019s RHAPSODY IN BLUE. Since then he has directed numerous concerts and shows. Of those most notably THE \u201cPOPS\u201d CONCERT (the music of the King of Jazz, Paul Whiteman) and his annual ART DECO REVUE. In September of 2008 he took a break from band leading to tour with JIMMY THACKERY AND THE DRIVERS. With that tour of duty ending in December 2010 Russ went back to being a band leader and running his own businesses, THE WILSON MUSIC COMPANY and WONDERTONE RECORDS putting all of his musical aggregations under one roof and one label.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"An Evening With comedian Eric Hunter w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/cG73cMXYhaJdmX9RWqutc91RR6N3wZYMUNyymlk_qac/mtime:1427987796/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Eric-Hunter.jpg?itok=IZCbKmhZ\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24247","path":"/show/evening-comedian-eric-hunter-w-contact-us-24","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Thursday May 7, 2015 : 8pm | : 9pm : Comedy : 18+ : seated, first come first serve $7 adv. / $10 d.o.s.

There\u2019s a hallowed hall, deep within the recesses of the heart, where an amazing truth resides: The power in your life can only be experienced when broken open and shared with the people who come into it. Back in 2005, Mike Farris cracked open the hallway door when, for the first time since the age of 15, he was clean and sober. Recording what would become the critically acclaimed Salvation in Lights (2007), a resurrected Mike eagerly anticipated the future. But with two ruptured discs, back surgery and the death of his beloved manager Rose McGathy all within a few weeks of the record\u2019s release, a rolling fog settled in. And with it, denial. Nevertheless, Mike\u2019s career was picking up steam. He won an Americana Music Award for New/Emerging Artist in 2008, followed by a Dove Award in 2010. His live performances at Bonnaroo, SxSW, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, and others-were drawing rave reviews. Revered artists like Rodney Crowell, Buddy Miller, Patty Griffin, and Marty Stuart were struck by his incomparable voice, and Mike opened shows for Patti LaBelle, Mavis Staples, Blind Boys of Alabama, Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby. By 2010, having released the award winning SHOUT! Live followed by an EP for Nashville flood relief efforts, Mike launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund his next record, an independent release. His fans generously funded the project. Serious invitations kept coming: first, to the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame\u2019s 16th Annual American Music Masters concert honoring Aretha Franklin, then TEDx Nashville, and then to the inaugural Austin City Limits Hall of Fame with Double Trouble. Mike\u2019s spirited, soul-gospel fusion had found an enthusiastic audience, but denial has a way of biting back. Compared to his former life, he thought he was fine, but truth be told, Mike had become addicted to pain medication. The new album would have to take a back seat to a gut-check, life-changing recovery. Mike went to rehab and finally began excavating the root causes of his addiction with the help of support groups at AA and NA. An isolator by nature, he struggled laying all his burdens on the table to complete strangers, but gained encouragement through the stories of others. Each honest step led to fertile, hopeful ground. What eventually emerged from that fertile ground is Shine For All The People, the evolution of true sobriety, of finding a new identity as a servant, first as a man but also as an artist. \u201cI\u2019d been working on the record before my recovery, and then there was a pretty huge delay,\u201d explains Mike, who recently signed with Compass Records. \u201cI had to back up, take time to grab the ground, to re-acclimate, to learn how to live now, truly sober for the first time since I was a kid.\u201d This new normal included getting back to the process of creating new music, but there was a distinctive trajectory shift in Mike. \u201cSo many avenues of music flow through me, 100s of years of music, the music that I grew up with-from Blues, Rock, R&amp;B and gospel-there had always been this pressure to try to force it into a box that would sell somehow. It\u2019s crazy and overwhelming at times, the weight of trying to meet expectations and make a living, but this time, that all fell away. I know now that this gift only exists to encourage people in their struggles, and if there\u2019s any power in it, it\u2019s not from me.\u201d Set for release in September 2014, Shine For All The People pushes beyond Salvation in Lights in that it reveals hope not in any glory to come, but in the failures and suffering of the present. \u201cMy music has always been first and foremost for the downtrodden, the wayward\u2026people who\u2019ve had to go up the rough side of the mountain. Even when it\u2019s upbeat and inspiring, there\u2019s always been an element of pain, because truth be told, we\u2019re all flawed. Not everybody knows it, but we all are.\u201d From the opening Cuban/St. Louis blues horns of \u201cRiver Jordan,\u201d originally written and performed by Blind Willie McTell, to the divine salvation of J.B. Lenoir\u2019s \u201cJonah &amp; the Whale,\u201d to the determined stance of the Rev. C.J. Johnson\u2019s \u201cSomething Keeps on Telling Me,\u201d a chorus/mantra that Mike fleshed out into a song in the months after rehab\u2026one listen, and it\u2019s clear there\u2019s something mystical in the waters here. \u201cWhen I first heard the Rev. C.J. Johnson\u2019s version, I could feel the air in that church get still, no music, only the sound of feet on the floor and hands in the air,\u201d Mike says. \u201cI got such strength from it, I knew I wanted to add part of my story. With his words as the chorus, and with Brigitte DeMeyer helping me out, the song serves as a compass for anyone who has lost their way.\u201d Mary Gauthier\u2019s soul-stirring \u201cMercy Now,\u201d one of the first songs Mike chose for the record, is clearly foundational to the whole. \u201cThe song just mystically appeared before me a few months before my Dad was diagnosed with lung cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only did it play a major role in just helping me deal with the year that followed, including his death, but brought comfort to my entire family.\u201d Like other choice cuts on Shine For All The People, the songs simply arrived at the appointed time, Mike says. \u201cThere was a time when I carried all the songwriting on my shoulders, but then the ego gets in the way of what it should be. These days, I don\u2019t have to write everything. I just open the door and these songs show up\u2026songs I need to hear in my struggle, songs I know people need to hear in theirs.\u201d Whether rearranging songs of centuries past or infusing new lyrical life to half-songs, it becomes clear that Mike\u2019s vocal gift is simply the surface of a very deep well. Full-tilt originals include \u201cReal Fine Day,\u201d a poetic account of the birth of Christian Blue Sky Farris that features some killer Kenny Vaughn guitar hooks-\u201ceasily one of the top three days of my life, that day,\u201d Mike says, and \u201cPower of Love,\u201d an unforgettable, high-energy soul groove and already an audience favorite. Shine For All the People bears witness to the determination of putting one foot in front of the other and to the power of music to get you there. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that falling is a divine thing,\u201d Mike adds. \u201cIt\u2019s part and parcel of being human. The important thing is to keep the faith and keep moving on and on. Daring to be courageous enough to share our deepest burdens with each other is the greatest gift we can give.\u201d Discography Goodnight Sun (2002) Independent Salvation In Lights (2007) INO/Columbia Records SHOUT!

WORLD PARTY: SEE A VIDEO: After a stint as musical director of a West End performance of The Rocky Horror Show, Wallinger joined a funk band called Ou Recorded at the Old Rectory in Eversholt, Bedfordshire in 1986, his debut album Private Revolution yielded two minor hits in the UK, \u201cPrivate Revolution\u201d and \u201cShip of Fools\u201d. \u201cShip Of Fools\u201d, however, did much better outside the UK \u2014 it reached no. 4 in Australia, no. 21 in New Zealand, and no. 27 in the US, in the process becoming the act\u2019s only major international hit. Between World Party\u2019s first and second albums, Wallinger aided Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor in recording her 1988 debut, The Lion and the Cobra. O\u2019Connor, then an unknown, had appeared as a guest on World Party\u2019s first album. She would go on to appear as a guest on the second LP as well. Goodbye Jumbo, World Party\u2019s second album, contained the minor UK hit singles \u201cWay Down Now\u201d and \u201cPut the Message in the Box\u201d.Goodbye Jumbo was voted \u201calbum of the year\u201d by Q magazine and was nominated for a Grammy Award for \u201cbest alternative music performance\u201d in the US. After the 1991 EP Thank You World (including a cover of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cHappiness Is a Warm Gun\u201d), Wallinger recruited guitarist David Catlin-Birch and ex-Icicle Works drummer Chris Sharrock as fully-fledged members for 1993\u2019s hit album Bang!. It reached no. 2 in the UK Albums Chart, with the track \u201cIs It Like Today?\u201d (no. 19 on the UK Singles Chart)[1] also becoming a moderately successful single in Europe. The success of Bang! saw World Party in the line-up for the Glastonbury Festival. In 1994, Wallinger did the soundtrack to the film Reality Bites, his first foray into filmscore work. Their fourth album, Egyptology (1997), included \u201cShe\u2019s the One\u201d which was subsequently recorded by Robbie Williams. Wallinger took a three-year break from World Party, before the release of Dumbing Up in 2000. However, in February 2001 he was struck down by an aneurysm that left him with no right hand vision in both eyes. After a long, five-year rehabilitation, in 2006 Wallinger re-emerged onto the scene. With his back catalogue reclaimed from EMI, a distribution deal was struck (via his own Seaview label) with Universal, and he played his first live show in a decade at the Austin, Texas-based South by Southwest festival. He played additional US dates in 2006. Big Blue Ball, a joint project with Peter Gabriel with production work by Stephen Hague (Pet Shop Boys, New Order) has also been released. In September 2007, World Party supported Steely Dan in both bands\u2019 first tour of Australia. In 2011 the band returned to the South by Southwest festival to play a free concert. In 2012 World Party released a new five CD collection of new songs, live recordings and cover versions. Titled \u201cArkeology\u201d. They played The Royal Albert Hall on November 1st 2012.

A slightly younger contemporary of Smokey Robinson and Ben E. King, he\u2019s cut a lasting place for himself in soul music from the late \u201950s right into the 21st century, if not as well-known a legacy as some of his contemporaries. Born Sidney Alexander Barnes in Welch, WV, he crossed paths in high school with Marvin Gaye, Herb Feemster (of Peaches &amp; Herb), and Van McCoy, among other future music stars; passing through the lineups of various bands before he hooked up with the Serenaders, a group that held a lot of promise that somehow never got fulfilled, despite a lion\u2019s share of talent in their ranks. By 1967, he had become part of the orbit of Marshall Chess\u2019 upstart Cadet Records, within the Chess Records organization as a member of Rotary Connection; and, he also saw one of his songs, \u201cHerbert Harper\u2019s Free Press News\u201d covered by no less a figure than Muddy Waters on the Electric Mud album. But, it was principally in association with other artists, as a songwriter, backup singer, and producer, that Barnes made his impact on music over the next 20 years. By the 1970s, Barnes was riding high on the soul, disco, and funk booms, working with George Clinton, Parliament, Funkadelic, and Deniece Williams, among others, while continuing to record with Minnie Riperton. His career momentum continued into the 1980s, but slowed down in the decade that followed. By the 1990s, however, he had found his recordings and his songs embraced in England by the Northern soul boom. In March of 2001, 44 years after he started in the business, Sidney Barnes made his first visit to England as a concert artist and was accorded a hero\u2019s welcome, worthy of any Motown, Chess, or Red Bird star. Sidney will perform with the Secret B-Sides as his super rocking funk band. SEE A VIDEO ft.

This incredible group balances a wide-variety of styles with melodic and meaningful lyrics to create a unique and ever-evolving musical experience. In June 2013, just 3 years after forming, Copious Jones signed with Kevon Glickman and international industry powerhouse, Blingnot Media. This partnership has already secured the band a spot in the 10th Annual Mountain Jam Festival, as well as the 8th Annual Bear Creek Music Festival, and opened the doors to a whole new realm of possibilities which Copious Jones is exploring with their sights set high. Audience members of all generations and walks of life can be found in the mix of fans at a Copious Jones show. Since the band\u2019s inception in 2010, these guys have quickly gone from being unrecognized on the local dive-bar scene to playing regularly in some of Atlanta\u2019s most reputable venues and headlining local and regional festivals. They\u2019ve also begun making appearances at national festivals and look forward to playing New York\u2019s, Mountain Jam this coming June, as well as Florida\u2019s, Bear Creek, in November. Every passing day adds a little more to the amazing story of these talented musicians. Though still a relatively young band, they have decades of combined musical experience and have already attracted attention from many notable figures in the music industry such as: Chuck Leavell (The Allman Brothers, The Rolling Stones), Rob Barraco (Phil Lesh &amp; Friends, Dark Star Orchestra) and Paul Diaz, owner of Tree Sound Studios (Elton John, Dave Matthews, Collective Soul). 2014 will find Copious Jones either in the studio creating music, or on the road solidifying and expanding their very-rapidly growing fan-base.

The album is an amalgamation of rapturous harmonies, sparkling instrumentals, poignant songwriting, and layers of imaginative arrangements that show off the band\u2019s folk roots, but with traces of funk, country, rap, R&amp;B, and New Wave-inspired dance beats. Hold On is an album that surveys the terrain of love with songs full of hope and ironic humor. All three members wrote and sing songs on Hold On, which allowed each to bring his own personality to the mix. \u201cEach of us has different styles so combining them gives us a unique sound,\u201d said Michalak. \u201cI get a lot of my inspiration from books and authors like Ernest Hemingway, Ronald Dahl, or Shel Silverstein\u2026James and Stuart get their inspiration from music, science/math, and computer programming.\u201d Dolph Ramseur, head of Ramseur Records/Management, discovered Bombadil on the band\u2019s MySpace page, caught their live show and signed them in 2006. He helped the group book tours and release records, including the Bombadil EP in 2006, A Buzz, A Buzz in 2008 and Tarpits and Canyonlands in 2009, the record that has often been referred to as \u201cthe album that should have made [Bombadil] famous.\u201d Just prior to its release, Michalak was diagnosed with neural tension, and consequently Bombadil could not tour or promote the record. Bombadil took a hiatus, and after several years of therapy, Michalak was able to return. The band regrouped in North Carolina for 2013\u2019s Metrics of Affection, a release that again received great reviews: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be truly original while still creating catchy pop tunes, and this band manages to do just that\u2026\u201d \u201cBombadil exerts a natural magic for telling tall tales with a splendid tendency towards casual detail.\u201d After an 18 month period of intense touring and songwriting, Bombadil has crafted a record packed with unforgettable melodies, imaginative sonic landscapes, and irresistible harmonies, making Hold On an early highlight of 2015. DARLINGSIDE The Boston based quartet features four distinct voices clustered around a single microphone; their tightly-arranged tunes drawing from the unexpected, including strains of bluegrass, classical, and even barbershop. Accompanied by an arsenal of classical strings, guitars, mandolin, and percussion, these four close friends swap instruments from song to song and offer a sound that defies standard genre classifications.

That\u2019s where Cissokho, a griot born to a family of professional musicians in Senegal, makes his transplanted home. The repertoire is pure Manding, the centuries-old musical culture of Cissokho\u2019s ancestors. It\u2019s reformulated with modernizing impulses in a rock band format: Agile basslines interweave with the melodic twins of kora and electric guitar, undergirded by an explosive rhythm section of djembe and trapset drums. Kora master Cissokho is also the group\u2019s vocal frontman. His electrifying voice propels songs old and new about timeless themes of mythology, migration and universal love. In fact, \u201cuniversal love\u201d is a rough translation of \u201cKaira Ba,\u201d a promise the band communicates live. The kora itself, a jumbo spike-lute with skin-and-gourd resonator, is handed down within families in West Africa. There, it represents a hereditary musical tradition of moral and spiritual gravitas. Cissokho maintains this heritage while walking his own path, playing with youthful fire and acrobatic effect. His North Carolina collaborators\u2014Will Ridenour, Austin McCall, John Westmoreland and Jonathan Henderson\u2014are diversely trained musicians who share a longtime love of African and African-based music. As a result, Kaira Ba has enjoyed a meteoric rise in its first two years of existence. In 2012, the band recorded Resonance, a shimmering studio album that captures all the drive and intensity of its live performances. The band has quickly become a hot ticket at festivals, museums and music venues across the Eastern U.S., touring as far afield as New York City and Senegal. Wherever they play, Diali Cissokho &amp; Kaira Ba summon audiences to the dancefloor with a bonanza of euphoric West African grooves, all inflected with funk, soul, rock and music of the Black Diaspora\u201d. \u2013 Sylvia Pfeiffenberger Arouna Diarra: A griot from the Mandingue culture of West Africa, Arouna Diarra is an accomplished n\u2019goni &amp; balafon player. Performing a tradition of folk songs reflecting topics from war to love for one another, Arouna sings with spirit, nostalgia, and great joy, in his native language, Bambara. Arouna was born in Bobo-Dioulasso, the cultural capital of Burkina Faso. Diarra is a family name associated with the griot. In West African culture, griots are curators of the arts and of history. Their families, like Arouna\u2019s, are composed of musicians, poets, and storytellers. Arouna was destined to bring traditional music into the modern day, further developing it while remaining true to it\u2019s roots. Performing styles such as Wassalou, Arouna brings a dynamic repertoire to the table, full of timing changes and improvisational prowess. He plays the kamel n\u2019goni \u2013 a 14-string harp-like instrument \u2013 with a melodic and percussive sensibility. In fact, Arouna makes his instruments himself, both for performing and for teaching his students. Before making his home in Asheville, North Carolina, Arouna was a key member of internationally-touring group, Lanaya. He is a founding member of NC-based, West African folk music ensemble, Mande Foly.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Dying to Live Theatre \u2013 [experimental theatre] w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/6HN2K5wZmJNlnFxaWzL7eHIO0qEwRlr_OuNdE3Ugt7s/mtime:1427987815/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Dying-to-Live-altamont-theatre_5.jpg?itok=g5NtIles\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24258","path":"/show/dying-live-theatre-%E2%80%93-experimental-theatre-w-contact-us-20","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Sunday April 19, 2015 : 3pm | : 4pm : experimental theatre : All Ages : This is a seated show, first come first serve Experimental theater on dying is birthed in Asheville.

She became friends with other singer-songwriters and musicians [in the \u201960s] who were creating their own unique sound. She talks about lining up at the legendary Troubadour at noon on Mondays to get a slot in the famous Monday night Troubadour \u201choot,\u201d which was a breaking ground for many artists who went on to great success. She says, \u201cIt was an amazing time. Jackson Thus the band Bryndle was born \u2013 one of the early songwriter groups, even before the Eagles. The band made an album for A&amp;M, but it was never released. They were, unfortunately, a bit ahead of their time. Bryndle broke up, but it launched four very illustrious careers. Kenny and Andrew joined Linda Ronstadt\u2019s band, and through that connection, Ronstadt was to hear a demo of hers. Karla recalled playing a tape of \u201cLose Again\u201d for her. \u201cHey, you know that\u2019s real good,\u201d Bonoff remembers Ronstadt saying, \u201cWhat else have you got?\u201d On Linda\u2019s \u201cHasten Down the Wind\u201d album [released in 1976], there were three Bonoff songs: \u201cSomeone to Lay Down Beside Me,\u201d \u201cIf He\u2019s Ever Near\u201d and \u201cLose Again.\u201d As Ronstadt was scoring hits with Karla Bonoff songs, Karla herself was signed as a solo artist to Columbia Records in 1977. There, she not only recorded the three songs Linda had done, but also the hit single \u201cI Can\u2019t Hold On\u201d and the tune \u201cHome,\u201d which later wound up on one of Bonnie Raitt\u2019s albums. The producer of this great first album [and the next two] was Karla\u2019s old friend and partner, Kenny Edwards. Bonoff then embarked on a solo tour to promote her album, and by the time she reached Seattle, \u201cI Can\u2019t Hold On\u201d was Number 1 in the Pacific Northwest. \u201cI was headlining and I barely had enough songs to play,\u201d Karla recalls, still amazed at the memory. \u201cSo I just kept playing them longer!\u201d She went from there to coveted spots on major tours, opening for James Taylor and Jackson Browne and earning a rave review in Time magazine. Two subsequent albums, \u201cRestless Nights\u201d [released in 1979] and \u201cWild Heart of the Young\u201d [released in 1982], established Karla as one of LA\u2019s major artists and songwriters. Musicians such as Russ Kunkel, Joe Walsh, Waddy Wachtel, Danny Kortchmar, Don Henley, Timothy Schmit, Peter Frampton, Bill Payne, J.D. Souther, and her old partners from Bryndle, Wendy Waldman, Andrew Gold and Kenny Edwards all participated in the making of these wonderful records. Bonoff had a big hit with \u201cPersonally,\u201d from her album \u201cWild Heart of the Young\u201d \u2013 a song Karla did not write. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019re people out there who only know me from this song, but I really enjoyed singing and recording it.\u201d Her fourth album, New World [first released in 1988], was originally released on Gold Castle, and is now available on the Valley Entertainment label. Karla began to tour in Japan, where audiences fell in love with her, and where she became a very successful artist \u2013 and continues to be to this day. There\u2019s been work in film \u2013 she and J.D. Southern wrote songs for the motion picture \u201cAbout Last Night.\u201d She is also the voice on the Tom Snow/Dean Pitchford song from \u201cFootloose\u201d called \u201cSomebody\u2019s Eyes.\u201d In 1994, Karla had a top-ten AC hit single with a song from the film \u201c8 Seconds,\u201d called \u201cStanding Right Next to Me.\u201d This track was produced by the legendary Keith Thomas (a longtime fan of Karla\u2019s) and written with her old partner, Wendy Waldman. Throughout the years, Karla has continued to do what she does best. She\u2019s toured with Bonnie Raitt, John Prine, J.D.Souther and others, building up a passionate audience, resulting in sold-out houses everywhere. In 1990, strange things began to happen in Karla\u2019s life. Her career came full circle. She wrote three songs which wound up on her old friend Linda Ronstadt\u2019s album \u201cCry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind.\u201d \u201cAll My Life,\u201d a duet with Ronstadt and Aaron Neville, won the Grammy for Best Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group. People magazine ranked \u201cAll My Life\u201d as one of the top 5 most popular wedding songs. In 1993, Karla\u2019s song \u201cTell Me Why,\u201d sung by the legendary Wynonna Judd [with Karla on acoustic guitar, and Bryndle members singing backup vocals], was the title song to Wynonna\u2019s second album, and a tremendous hit. The Eight Seconds soundtrack album [released in 1994], featured the aforementioned \u201cStanding Right Next to Me\u201d and a duet with Vince Gill on \u201cWhen Will I Be Loved,\u201d [a \u201970s hit for Linda Ronstadt] bringing Karla\u2019s sound to an even bigger Country music audience. Karla and her three old partners, Kenny Edwards, Andrew Gold and Wendy Waldman, then decided it was time to put Bryndle back together again. The thought had always been there, but now with each person having experienced many successes alone, there was much more to bring to the Bryndle experience. \u201cWhen we decided to put this band back together,\u201d Bonoff explains, \u201cwe realized that one of the things that was wrong with it the first time was that we all wrote separately. We thought it would be great to write together this time. It\u2019s been new and really fun to do that, thefour of us.\u201d Twelve out of the 14 songs on Bryndle\u2019s CD were written as a group. In the fall of \u201995, after four years of hard work, the first Bryndle CD came out, released in the United States and Japan. The band toured Japan in the summer, then began to tour the United States. Karla had some incredible showstoppers on the record and onstage. \u201cOn the Wind,\u201d \u201cUnder the Rainbow\u201d and \u201cDaddy\u2019s Little Girl\u201d brought the house down every single night no matter where Bryndle played. Bonoff fans flocked to the shows and were thrilled to see her with her old friends, having a great time. In 1996, Andrew Gold left the band but Bryndle continued on, performing into the summer of 1997. A duet with the Dirt Band, \u201cYou Believed in Me,\u201d written with Wendy Waldman, was released in January of that year on a prestigious MCA album honoring the 1996 Olympics. In 1999, Sony/CBS Legacy released \u201cAll My Life \u2013 The Best of Karla Bonoff,\u201d a 16-song fully remastered collection spanning Karla\u2019s entire career. An extensive article by Billboard Editor-In-Chief Timothy White and an interview with Karla were included with the CD. Progress on Bryndle\u2019s follow-up CD [with the working title of \u201cBryndle 2\u2033] stopped and started after 1997 and for a few years, it appeared there might not be another release by the band. At one point, parts of the unfinished \u201cBryndle 2\u2033 digital recordings were lost in a hard drive crash \u2013 a nearly fatal omen to the project. Meanwhile, Karla [accompanied by Kenny Edwards] began touring more as a solo act as Bryndle stopped performing live. In 2001, enthusiasm for the \u201cBryndle 2\u2033 project built up within the band and the recording pace intensified. Regular sessions took place at Kenny\u2019s Santa Barbara studio and Wendy\u2019s San Fernando Valley \u201cLong House Studio.\u201d Former bandmate Andrew Gold contributed to the recording as well. Finally, in the first week of 2002, \u201cHouse of Silence,\u201d the second collection of songs from Bryndle, was independently released. Although there\u2019s a different feel to the recording compared with the first album, it still reflected the unique sound that these artists make when their talents merge. In November of 2002, Karla, Kenny Edwards and Wendy Waldman played their first show together under the Bryndle banner in more than 4 years. The setting was an intimate house concert in the Los Angeles area. Rumors of a CD release of \u201cThe House Concerts\u201d have begun circulating. Although there are no plans for Bryndle presently, the members remain friends and there\u2019s always the possibility of future recordings and performances. In a 2000 magazine article, Karla described herself as \u201csemi-retired\u201d \u2013 content with going out on short tours a few times a month. But she\u2019s also talked of recording a new album as well \u2013 perhaps at home. \u201cI\u2019d like to make a record completely for myself, one that isn\u2019t governed by what other people in the business think it needs to be,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to go audition. I don\u2019t need a record company to pay for it. I can put it out on the Internet and it doesn\u2019t really cost anything. If a record company picks it up, great. If they don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d \u201cI always had somebody mad at me because I wasn\u2019t making records, keeping up the pace,\u201d revealed Ms. Bonoff, who writes about four songs a year. \u201cI\u2019m really not that prolific \u2013 I think I\u2019ve spent so much time trying to fit a round peg into a square hole that I just sort of worked my way out of wanting to write anymore. And I got a bad taste in my mouth about not being able to just be myself. I think in the time I\u2019ve taken off, I\u2019ve watched music change to the point where I really see songwriters \u2013 and women in particular \u2013 being able to write about what they want to. So it encourages me to just go, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m just going to write whatever I want, and I\u2019m just going to make the record I want.'\u201d When it comes, a new collection of songs from Karla Bonoff will be exactly her vision of what it should sound like, and well worth the wait. In 2007, Karla finally released a live double CD, a project she had talked about for years. \u201cI think many of these songs have improved with age and and I have never really documented what we do.\u201d Karla recorded all but one song of it at a small club in Santa Barbara with her long time touring band, Kenny Edwards and Nina Gerber, plus Scott Babcock on percussion. Karla continues to perform all over America. Often after her concerts, Karla talks with fans and signs CDs and well-worn LP covers people bring to her shows. Japan has also been very supportive of Karla\u2019s music and she\u2019s toured there twice in recent years. An expanded version of her \u201cBest Of\u201d CD collection as well as Bryndle\u2019s \u201cHouse of Silence\u201d were released in Japan in 2002. Sadly, during the summer of 2010, Kenny Edwards required an emergency med-flight back to his home in Southern California, and was hospitalized with rapidly advancing prostate cancer. He passed away peacefully August 18th in Santa Barbara CA among an outpouring of loving words, thoughts, generosity, and kindness from friends and fans around the world. Karla writes on her web site, \u201cI want to thank Kenny for being my teacher, my musical partner and my best friend for the last forty-three years.\u201d Karla\u2019s legacy as a writer and perseverance as a performer are spoken best in a Billboard Magazine review of Karla\u2019s \u201cAll My Life\u201d recording. \u201cLong before Alanis and Jewel, there was a breed of singer/songwriters whose earthly anthems of soul-searching, heartache and joy touched souls in a way few can muster today.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"An Evening with Caravan of Thieves \u2013 [acoustic swingin\u2019 folk, roots &amp; gypsy music] w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/YL-n_PVs0LJoepmrnUQFGG7FvxltyPoQlZy3giYG76Y/mtime:1427987814/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Caravan-of-Thieves-2-%40-Altamont_0.jpg?itok=atAMf1On\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24260","path":"/show/evening-caravan-thieves-%E2%80%93-acoustic-swingin%E2%80%99-folk-roots-gypsy-music-w-contact-us-28","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Wednesday April 15, 2015 : 7:00pm | : 8:00pm : acoustic swingin\u2019 folk, roots &amp; gypsy music : All Ages! : mix of seats and standing $15 adv. / $18 d.o.s. : SEE A VIDEO: \u201cDead Wrong\u201d Official video: When Fuzz and Carrie Sangiovanni of Caravan of Thieves first met, there was an instant spark, an intimate connection and passion for life and adventure, which has continued through their personal and artistic relationship. In the spring of 2008, Fuzz and Carrie extended their journey to include fiery violinist Ben Dean and double bass maestro, Brian Anderson completing their colorful vision. Since then, the four of them ran away from home and never looked back. Within that first year, Caravan of Thieves began to win immediate praise for their unique blend of gypsy swing and popular music, inspiring them to record and release the debut full-length album Bouquet (2009). To accompany this collection of dramatic and satirical tales, they built an interactive stage set of percussive junk and the quartet took their newly animated show on the road, sharing stages with world renowned artists such as Emmylou Harris, Dan Hicks, Glen Campbell, Nanci Griffith, The Decemberists, Keb Mo, Tom Tom Club, Iron and Wine, Punch Brothers, Tony Trischka, John Hammond, John Jorgenson and many others. The Caravan successfully connected with audiences on each of these diverse bills, proving their act to be understood and appreciated by folk, pop, rock and jazz audiences of all ages. The group continued to reach new fans with each release, Mischief Night (2010) and The Funhouse (2012). Now the group gear up for their newest release, KISS KISS, which comes out March 31. KISS KISS combines the dark humor and sarcastic social commentary of their previous efforts with an added emphasis on love and all the beauty and danger it brings. They have created the music to match, adding in tuba, beat box, and everything including the kitchen sink to draw listeners in to the Caravan of Thieves\u2019 world. According to Fuzz and Carrie, \u201cWe enjoy writing about concepts that most listeners can relate to while seeing how far we can bring it to the edges of our imaginations, and try to use as many unexpected images and comparisons as we can to illustrate them. One of the main themes behind KISS KISS is love, which is already so complex, so we tried to cover as many angles as possible, the good the bad and yes, even the ugly.\u201d KISS KISS finds Caravan of Thieves expanding their wheelhouse further than ever before. On \u201cDisappear,\u201d Spanish guitar style and Middle Eastern string arrangements accompany haunting vocal melodies. The fun and festive feel of \u201cHome\u201d is colored by the tuba, marching snare, bass drum and cymbals, along with circus organ and lots of colorful chimes. \u201cDead Wrong\u201d reflects on love gone wrong, with dark lyrics and a bluesy melody conjuring up an old timey feel. \u201cMust Be Love\u201d takes the opposite approach, about being head over hells in love, with lush strings and dreamy orchestra bells. Caravan of Thieves hearken back to a day gone by, the swing era, when music and entertainment reached a creative height but was not yet diluted by big business and commercialism. Tin pan alley songwriters, late romantic and early 20th century classical composers, early jazz and swing musicians and vaudeville entertainers guided them to the sound they made their own. Artists such as Duke Ellington and Django Reinhardt brought an elegance and style along with a fun and free spirit and precision craftsmanship to their music, which Caravan have taken in and absorbed. According to Fuzz and Carrie, \u201cOur ultimate goal is to always thoroughly entertain our audience, in concert and on our records, and to build a community who we can feel connected to, and who feels connected to us. As we see it, or maybe just imagine it, the traveling camps of gypsies or traveling circus performers lived outside the social norms, lived a more bohemian lifestyle. They had communities and families they were a part of and made music and performed with them. This is the world we are trying to create. We avoid living a life that might be expected of us through social norms and conformity, and we live to create these communities through our music. And we try to embody the spirit and liveliness of the old time entertainers to help invite more and more people into our timeless world</p>\n"},{"node_title":"An Evening with Reasonably Priced Babies \u2013 [Asheville improv comedy] w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/WrD9qUSMz8YSpNyz0EyJj5G3S-_e1yWVjI_EO-bynVw/mtime:1427987814/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/RPB_7.jpg?itok=7e_c1qAq\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24261","path":"/show/evening-reasonably-priced-babies-%E2%80%93-asheville-improv-comedy-w-contact-us-26","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Thursday April 16, 2015 : 8pm | : 9pm : improv comedy : 18+ : seated, first come first serve $10 Improv Comedy of Western North Carolina and called into being by the Universal Mind to spread joy, odd noises and viral goofiness for the betterment of man.

Her husband Christmas Davis, plays guitar, writes the songs and howls along. The Tall Pines are a Brooklyn, NY based couple that revel in the spirits of the late 1960s and early 1970s Country-Soul, and Swamp-Rock scenes, while striving to take the sounds they love beyond history and into the next wave of American Music. Their first self-titled album was voted one of the top ten best records of the year by Meredith Ochs at NPR in 2007. They\u2019ve performed live with Country music great Charlie Louvin (RIP) at the CMJ music festival, with Norah Jones and Puss N Boots, Justin Townes Earl, Kevn Kinny of Drivn\u2019 and Cryin\u2019, Amy Ray of The Indigo Girls, and many more great folks. They play regularly in NYC, Nashville and at various festivals. Their new EP \u2013 \u201cBlack Ribbon\u201d \u2013 will be released in June of 2014. The Civil Wars are certainly civil compared to The Tall Pines. They do not fear to tread where more tender souls would be burned to a crisp. ~ Amos Perrine: No Depression With long straight hair falling over sky-high cheekbones and a penchant for floor-length dresses, Connie Petruk looks like she stepped out of late \u201960s/early \u201970s Nashville and sings like the lost sister of Bobbie Gentry or Dusty Springfield. Her honeyed alto will melt the frost off your windshield, and the band\u2019s confident backing matches her attitude flawlessly. The Tall Pines are equal parts soul and twang, molasses and moonshine, sass and skill. The songs, all written by Christmas Davis and inspired by his Southern upbringing, evoke the heyday of the country-soul hybrid without ever sounding unoriginal, a difficult feat. ~ Meredith Ochs: NPR : SEE A VIDEO: Casey Driessen has spent his career pushing the boundaries of fiddle music. With the release of his new album, THE SINGULARITY, the 34-year old virtuoso proves that the possibilities of one man, one five-string fiddle, and one pedal board are endless. THE SINGULARITY, Driessen\u2019s third record, is a solo album in every sense of the phrase\u2014the only sounds listeners hear are created by the looping of fiddle and voice. It was self-recorded and self-produced at his home studio\u2014which is really more of a laboratory\u2014in between touring with The Flecktones, Tim O\u2019Brien, and Darrell Scott, and opening for the Zac Brown Band. There aren\u2019t even any guest musicians\u2014unless you count Driessen\u2019s daughter, whose in utero heartbeat was the inspiration behind \u201cHeartbeat Kid,\u201d an instrumental (and the subject of his 2012 TEDx Talk) that resonates with any parent who can remember the first time they heard the rapid thump of their child\u2019s heart. The album grew out of Driessen\u2019s captivating live shows, where the audience would experience music as it was created and recorded in front of their eyes when Driessen, stomping his trademark red shoes over every inch of the pedal board, would lay down, then layer, then loop, several individual tracks on songs like \u201cBillie Jean,\u201d assembling parts like a musical Dr. Frankenstein. It was that Michael Jackson cover that first sent Driessen down the Singularity rabbit hole when, as a practice tool, he deconstructed the song, learning how its components interacted before working up an arrangement. \u201cThese arrangements are an accurate representation of the live performances,\u201d Driessen explains. \u201cThere\u2019s no multi-tracking\u2014in keeping with the nature of this project, listeners are only hearing my voice and what I send through the pedal board.\u201d Driessen draws on a number of wide-ranging influences from Tom Waits (an eerie cover of \u201cMurder in the Red Barn\u201d is one of two Singularity songs to feature vocals) to Stevie Wonder to jazz violinist Stuff Smith. He\u2019s particularly drawn to the improvisational elements of bebop, the groove of R&amp;B, and percussion rich global cultures. His \u201cTanuki Attack\u201d is all percussive fiddle, \u201ca tune without any notes,\u201d he jokes. It was inspired by the sounds made while Driessen experimented with chopping, a percussive bowing technique that only developed in the last 60-some years\u2014a short time when considering the violin\u2019s centuries-old history. Driessen\u2019s continued interest in percussion has also led to the creation of FIDDLE/STICKS, an ongoing audio and video project in which he collaborates with drummers like Jamey Haddad, Kenny Malone, and Futureman. Though the GRAMMY-nominated Driessen has participated in several genre-blending ventures, including Bela Fleck and Abigail Washburn\u2019s Sparrow Quartet, at his core, he is a bluegrass fiddler, albeit one who honed his skills at Berklee College of Music. Here, he pays tribute to his roots with a stirring version of the traditional tune \u201cWorking on a Building,\u201d using an arrangement he developed one year at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. It\u2019s the only song on THE SINGULARITY that doesn\u2019t use any looping or pedals. Driessen\u2019s arrangement is just voice and fiddle\u2014the way roots music began, surrounded by what roots music can be.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"INTANGIBLE \u2013 Earth Day Party w/ Numatik, Living Light, Arouna Diarra &amp; Damascus (NIGHT) w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/LKxoMJRLc94ZBJGqp0Oaj3vCqzuiG11vkO6Wq4E6deM/mtime:1428600742/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Earth-Day-NIGHT.jpg?itok=mT9tM9bi\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24266","path":"/show/intangible-%E2%80%93-earth-day-party-w-numatik-living-light-arouna-diarra-damascus-night-w-contact-us-4","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Wednesday April 22, 2015 : 6pm | : 6pm : electronic / multi-media : All Ages! : mix of seats and standing You can purchase a combo ticket for both DAY &amp; NIGHT for $20 .</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Stars","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/cNkEOpzCexrbSHWmI_nPMztmropVSHozkB8DJknHsQ8/mtime:1420739095/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/stars_2.jpg?itok=ZmlaW4O9\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=6525951&partner_id=240","nid":"18679","path":"/show/stars-0","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7311","body":"<p>Like their celestial namesake, <strong>Stars</strong> only come out at night.

The band\u2019s seven albums, three Grammy nominations and the Country Music Association Award for Best Overseas Touring Act would build an indelible bridge between authentic American Roots music and millions of fans worldwide. With BR on hiatus, Chuck formed The Hillbilly All-Stars featuring members of The Mavericks, co-produced popular tribute albums to Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings, guest-lectured at Vanderbilt University, and became a staff writer at one of Nashville\u2019s top song publishers. In 2009, he released his acclaimed solo debut album, Journeyman\u2019s Wager, and toured clubs, concert halls and international Rock, Country and Rockabilly festivals with his band The Grassy Knoll Boys. As Music Director for the Broadway smash Million Dollar Quartet, Chuck began crafting the music arrangements during the show\u2019s original Daytona and Seattle workshop productions, supervised the musical performances for its 2008 Chicago opening, created new music material for the show\u2019s Tony Award-winning Broadway run, produced the original cast album, and oversaw the music for its smash 2011 premiere at London\u2019s No\u00ebl Coward Theatre. In 2013, MDQ broke the Chicago record for longest running musical. Chuck\u2019s acclaimed 2012 release, Back At The Quonset Hut, was recorded at Nashville\u2019s legendary Quonset Hut Studio where Patsy Cline, George Jones, Merle Haggard Roger Miller, Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash and more cut some of country\u2019s greatest tracks. Produced by original BR549 producer Mike Janas and with the participation of students from Belmont University\u2019s College of Entertainment and Music Business, the album of classic covers features surviving members of Music Row\u2019s original \u2018A Team\u2019 studio musicians as well as guest appearances by Old Crow Medicine Show, Elizabeth Cook, Jamie Johnson and Bobby Bare. 2014 ushers in Free State Serenade, the new Chuck Mead &amp; His Grassy Knoll Boys release on Nashville-based Plowboy Records. Produced by long-time ally and friend Joe Pisapia (kd Lang, Ben Folds Five) and featuring BR549\u2019s Don Herron, Old Crow Medicine Show\u2019s Critter Fuqua, Alan Murphy, Will Rambeaux, and Mark Andrew Miller, Free State Serenade is Chuck Mead\u2019s strongest effort yet. \u201cIt\u2019s been incredibly liberating to do all these things I\u2019ve never done before. I\u2019ve already gone from the bars of Lower Broadway in Nashville to the Broadway stage, and the upcoming album is one of the most unique and rewarding projects I\u2019ve ever been a part of. I\u2019m looking forward to where it all brings me next.\u201d : SEE A VIDEO: East Nashville, TN 2014-\u201cDon\u2019t walk away, I\u2019m talking to you,\u201d sings Aaron Lee Tasjan in the first chorus of the first song off of his new EP, Crooked River Burning. The song is aptly titled Don\u2019t Walk Away and covers a lot of ground in four minutes and twenty-one seconds. It is, in it\u2019s own way, much like the artist himself: filled with insight and brutal honesty, humorous and sincere in a fashion which is truly unique to the man delivering the song. These songs have been heard all across the USA this past year; in just about every bar, parking lot, van and music club that is still open and still puts on live music. As you listen to the songs on this EP, you begin to understand that while Tasjan seemingly works endlessly to bring his music to whomever will listen out on the road, he is also singing these songs because he has to. There is pain within the reedy Midwestern drawl of his voice but also the ability to laugh at life\u2019s misfortunes and ultimately transcend them by putting into words and music all of his thoughts and experiences along the way. Produced by Anton Fier (Bob Mould, Golden Palominos), the EP also features Fier on drums and Chris Morrissey (Taurus, Andrew Bird) on bass and upright bass. Recorded live with ALT, Fier and Morrissey all tracking at the same time, there is a feeling of immediacy and human interaction happening in these cuts that is greatly benefited by Tasjan\u2019s laid back approach to technical prowess and highly effective regard for feel. The performances are spirited and the songs are of such quality that Tasjan was even recently honored by ASCAP at The Kennedy Center as one of America\u2019s great songwriters of the next generation. Now living in Nashville, TN, his list of accomplishments and accolades continues to grow, but one only need listen to the songs on this EP to realize that Tasjan can accomplish what few can musically, he can write songs that make you laugh and cry at once all while revealing himself to you in a manner such that you feel connected to something healing and powerful.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Cheryl Wheeler w/SPECIAL GUEST Kenny White \u2013 [folk] w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/2S90yEziIs6mcGf7PTx_sWCqDbW5C_ZSxXQGqvbNU_k/mtime:1428600743/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Cheryl-Wheeler-%40-The-Altamont1.jpg?itok=jeldfo14\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24251","path":"/show/cheryl-wheeler-wspecial-guest-kenny-white-%E2%80%93-folk-w-contact-us-25","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Saturday April 25, 2015 : 7pm | : 8pm : folk : All Ages! : seated, first come first serve $25 SEE A VIDEO: Cheryl Wheeler has to be seen to be appreciated. Nothing you read and nothing you hear from her albums prepares you for how entertaining a performer she is. If you\u2019re not already familiar with Cheryl, you have probably heard her music. She is very respected as a songwriter by her peers, which can be seen by how many of them record her songs. Cheryl\u2019s songs have been covered by artists as diverse as Dan Seals, Peter Paul &amp; Mary, Kenny Loggins, Garth Brooks, Suzy Bogguss, Melanie, Bette Midler, Maura O\u2019Connell, Sylvia, Kathy Mattea, and Holly Near. From her albums you can tell that she is a gifted songwriter with a beautiful voice. From other people\u2019s comments about her you learn that she is a natural storyteller with a fantastic sense of humor. But until you see her in person, you never really believe what you\u2019ve been told about her. Interestingly enough, almost half of the songs she performs during her shows have never been recorded! Cheryl\u2019s first concert was to a captive audience. She found an old toy ukelele in a neighbor\u2019s attic and serenaded her mother who was taking a bath at the time. A year later she got a real ukelele, followed by her first guitar. She learned guitar from a neighbor, who also taught a group of boys. Each week they would get together and play just about any song they could think of for hours on end. Her first public performance was at a Hootenanny when she was 12. She started writing her own songs when she was 17. Cheryl has never had a \u201cday job,\u201d and her first professional gigs were at the Steak and Ale Restaurant in her home town of Timonium, Maryland. The place only had one PA system; in the middle of her songs you would hear: \u201cJones, party of four \u2026Jones, party of four.\u201d She finally convinced them to get a second PA system. She performed at venues around Baltimore and Washington DC before moving to New England in 1976, where she now lives. She tours extensively, often performing solo or with Kenny White, who often opens her shows as well. She appeared as part of the On a Winter\u2019s Night tour, and was part of the Philo 25th Anniversary tour. Her funny stories between songs reveal her talent for diversity. Each time she tells a story, it will be a little bit different, so even if you\u2019ve heard it before, you still find yourself laughing.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Les Femmes Mystique presents: \u201cSecrets Travel Fast in Paris\u201d w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24252","path":"/show/les-femmes-mystique-presents-%E2%80%9Csecrets-travel-fast-paris%E2%80%9D-w-contact-us-28","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Friday April 24, 2015 : 7:00pm | : 8pm : dance/cabaret/music : 18+ : standing/seats $12 adv. / $15 d.o.s. presents: \u201cSecrets Travel Fast in Paris\u201d It\u2019s time to escape those winter blues and welcome the first moments of Spring.

Known for their roaring live sets, Dustbowl bravely brings together many styles of traditional American music. Some call it string band-brass band mash up. Maybe it\u2019s called Swing grass or good old Americana. Imagine Old Crow Medicine Show teaming up with Louis Armstrong\u2019s Hot Fives and Sevens, or Bob Dylan and The Band jamming with Benny Goodman and his orchestra in 1938. It\u2019s infectious, joyous music \u2013 a youthful take on time-worn American traditions. Named \u201cBest Live Band in LA\u201d by The LA Weekly, each Dustbowl performance promises to be a white-knuckle ride through the history of American folk music that rarely stays just on the stage. Call it the new old-timey dance party sound made fresh by some of the best soloists in the business. Most of the gang is classically trained though you might not know it when some of the funk breaks out. After placing several songs on ABC and Fox and having tunes featured in independent films like \u201cMade In China\u201d (winner of SXSW) winning Americana song of the year from the Independent Music Awards (Tom Waits judging), playing festivals like Outside Lands and opening for bands like Lake Street Dive, Rebirth Brass Band, Preservation Hall Jazz Band and Trombone Shorty, the band began barnstorming more extensively across the USA. Festivals on tap in 2015 include Floydfest (VA), Clearwater Hudson Revival (NY), The Winnipeg Folk Festival, Naked Song Fest (Netherlands) and Bergenfest (Norway) where they will join Tori Amos, First Aid Kit and Jackson Browne. Founder Z. Lupetin came west from Chicago in 2007 and placed a humble Craigslist ad to get the circus started. The group has grown steadily from a small string band playing up and down the west coast, into a traveling mini orchestra featuring instrumentation that often includes fiddle, mandolin, trombone, clarinet, trumpet, ukelele, drums, tuba, organ, a bass made from a canoe oar, harmonica and plenty of washboard and kazoo for good luck. They have settled into an eight piece touring machine \u2013 rattling ceilings and sometimes bringing their grinning sound into the street. With their latest offerings Holy Ghost Station and Carry Me Home getting solid play on NPR and rising on the Americana charts, the band is slated for a big 2015. A small European tour is in the works. They have recorded their first live album at San Francisco\u2019s Great American Music Hall and LA\u2019s famed Troubadour and will be releasing it in June. In the meantime they will tour the Pacific Northwest, The Midwest and East coast. <strong>MISS TESS &amp; THE TALKBACKS</strong> MISS TESS &amp; THE TALKBACKS <br> <code></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLjxfehepBI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <code></code> <br> <a href=\"http://www.misstessmusic.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.misstessmusic.com/', 'http://www.misstessmusic.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.misstessmusic.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.misstessmusic.com/\">http://www.misstessmusic.com/</a> <br> Miss Tess &amp; The Talkbacks is a grooving rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band rooted in swinging blues, throwback country, and rockabilly music from Brooklyn, NY.

The band, with its self-described modern vintage sound, is currently in the studio writing and recording material for their tenth album. A sneak preview of two of their new tunes will be released as a 45 single and download in spring, 2015 on Signature Sounds Recordings (Lake Street Dive, Eilen Jewell, Chris Smither, Josh Ritter, Erin McKeown). Their most recent release, The Love I Have For You, (2013 Signature Sounds Recordings) features six covers and one new original, and pays homage to some of Tess\u2019s favorite singers and songwriters including Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Neil Young, Ted Hawkins, Randy Newman, and Hank Williams. The album was produced by Miss Tess &amp; The Talkbacks and recorded and mixed by Devin Greenwood (Norah Jones, Anais Mitchell, Amos Lee) in Brooklyn, NY. \u201cEach artist we covered has held a special place in the history of our lives, as well as in the history of American music,\u201d says Miss Tess. \u201cThese folks are all musical giants who dedicated their lives to music, and for that I hold them in the highest esteem.\u201d Miss Tess &amp; the Talkbacks have won fans from New York City to New Orleans and Alabama to Alaska. Over the years they have shared the stage with the likes of Lake Street Dive, NRBQ, The Holmes Brothers, Eilen Jewell, and Todd Snider. The band has graced stages at Blissfest, Cayamo, Clearwater Jazz Holiday, Floydfest, Ossippee Valley Music Festival, Bristol Rhythm &amp; Roots Reunion, Burlington Jazz Festival, and Green River Festival. Miss Tess\u2019s music has been heard from coast to coast on taste maker programs such as XM/Sirius\u2019s The Loft, NPR\u2019s Folk Alley, Santa Cruz\u2019s KPIG and Boston\u2019s WUMB. Miss Tess grew up in Maryland, where she took piano lessons at an early age. She went to college in Baltimore, intending to be a graphic artist. While there, she dabbled in guitar, but it wasn\u2019t until the end of her studies that she began taking it seriously. Once she became more confident as a musician, she started studying jazz and writing songs. Miss Tess then put together her first band. Having grown up listening to her parents\u2019 bands playing big band swing, folk, country and dixieland music, these rootsy styles came naturally to her. After a move to Boston, Miss Tess took a few classes at Berklee College of Music and formed a new band with a few fellow jazz students. Miss Tess quickly established herself as a songwriter and performer in the storied Boston music scene, playing regularly at local clubs. Over four years she won a Boston Music Award, and was nominated several other times in the Folk and Jazz categories. Miss Tess later moved to Brooklyn and has been there for almost five years. She has since developed her sound to include more classic country, rockabilly and vintage rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. <br> <em><br> \u201cNashville meets Brooklyn\u2026country chic.\u201d</em> <br> \u201cNashville meets Brooklyn\u2026country chic.\u201d \u2014 <strong>Village Voice</strong> Village Voice <em>\u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone else right now touring in the Americana scene that has such an eclectic, jazzy, old school and interesting vibe.

This is music that uplifts, that soars, but that is also grounded by a respect and love for tradition. With just three acoustic instruments\u2013fiddle, guitar, upright bass\u2013Haas Kowert Tice are building a new kind of roots music. Made up of three of the most exciting instrumentalists on the scene today, this trio of fiddler Brittany Haas (Crooked Still), bassist Paul Kowert (Punch Brothers), and guitarist Jordan Tice (Tony Trischka) have come together on their debut album, you got this, to use their string band roots to engage in close dialogue. Entirely instrumental, this is wordless communication heard from three distinct voices working for unity. \u201cThere is so much we don\u2019t have to say to each other,\u201d explains Paul Kowert. \u201cWe got together because we wanted a project in which we could explore our ideas\u2013we wanted to see what we could find. We each contributed writing, and were each able to tinker with each other\u2019s ideas. I think in this album you hear discovery.\u201d That joy of discovery is key to this collaboration of master instrumentalists. It\u2019s also the fuel that\u2019s powered their careers so far: Brittany Haas exploring fiddle traditions with Bruce Molsky, Darol Anger, and Alasdair Fraser; Paul Kowert\u2019s ground-breaking work with The Punch Brothers and now Dave Rawlings Machine, and his studies with Edgar Meyer; Jordan Tice\u2019s ensembles and recordings with like-minded artists like Noam Pikelny and Casey Driessen. The thread that ties this all together is a driving passion to share great music with friends. Trying to track the many overlapping influences on you got this is a labyrinthine process. For example, \u201cGrandpa\u2019s Cheesebarn,\u201d a tune composed by Jordan Tice, brings together alternate banjo tunings, Norwegian dance tunes, hard-rocking folk rhythms, and Debussy-like string arrangements. \u201cWe\u2019re all living lives that are bursting at the seams with all sorts of music,\u201d Haas explains. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been inspired by similar things over the years and have inspired and influenced each others\u2019 musical paths.\u201d Haas Kowert Tice also love to experiment with delicate balances. Opening tune \u201cLeadfoot\u201d slips back and forth between a buoyant dance tune and the deep growling of Kowert\u2019s bass lines. \u201cTell Me Whatcha Gonna Do Now\u201d trades off a gorgeous, pastoral guitar line from Tice with Haas\u2019 devilishly syncopated fiddling, incorporating sudden moments of softness and tranquility. There\u2019s an element of surprise to the music of Haas Kowert Tice; tunes take unexpected turns, and melodies duck and weave in abrupt and exciting directions. All three artists in Haas Kowert Tice have built their careers on their ability to move on the razor\u2019s edge of tradition and innovation. They have a nearly unlimited arsenal of tools gathered from years in top-flight ensembles, but they\u2019re not interested in flashy displays. This young trio would rather move their audiences with unique melodies, powerful arrangements, searingly beautiful playing on the fiddle and guitar, and stomach-rumbling chords and eloquent passages on the upright bass. They see each tune as a journey that they take with their listeners, but also as a path that they can travel together, discovering new ideas and new passions around every corner.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"First Fridays with Zansa + SPECIAL GUESTS \u2013 [afropop/world] w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/ffvQrnxlDUHgiHoyKVa0CUttnuA22berKy8DCM2Kcz8/mtime:1428600743/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Zansa-First-Fridays-SQUARE.jpg?itok=Fw3txFDg\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","nid":"24253","path":"/show/first-fridays-zansa-special-guests-%E2%80%93-afropopworld-w-contact-us","date_group":"2015-04-09 00:00:00","venue":"7315","body":"<p>: Friday May 1, 2015 : 7:30pm | : 8:30pm : afropop/world : All Ages! : seats and standing Every month features new special guests! SEE A VIDEO: The music of Zansa, a Nouchi slang word from Ivory Coast meaning \u201ccombination\u201d or \u201cblend,\u201d is a synthesis of traditional and modern styles of West Africa. The Asheville, NC-based ensemble melds African folk music with modern afropop, African drumming, and the dance-oriented Ivorian street music called Zouglou. Zansa is led by 33rd generation West African musician Adama Dembele, a native of Ivory Coast, who began his music career in the late \u201990s by founding the drum &amp; dance group Djembeso. He adapted traditional songs and rhythms, eventually molding them into his own style. After moving to Asheville, NC in 2005, Dembele has continued to develop and expand his sound, now singing in multiple languages- French, Baoule, Bambara, and English. Today, Zansa is taking those traditional African songs and rhythms and incorporating Western instruments, such as electric guitar, violin, bass, and drum set, offering a wide range of sonic possibilities. The music is rooted in the West African drumming tradition Dembele was born into and blended with a modern approach, lending familiarity to foreign sounds. The result is an original take on the authentic music of West Africa.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"The First Songsmith Showcase ft.

The project originated with the intention of creating country music demos but ended up as an 8-piece band with a full length album and a follow up scheduled for release in 2015. With minimal marketing or publicity, an ever-growing fan base quickly developed. Within weeks, their music received air play on local radio, a live band was assembled, and some of their songs were licensed through Nicki Jack Publishing. Raising Caine has been playing established venues in the Asheville, NC area including Isis Music Hall, the Grey Eagle Tavern, and the New Earth Music Hall as well as festivals such as Bonnaroo, Mountain Sports Fest, &amp; Appalachian Shakedown.

Armed to the teeth with a honeyed voice, a cello and bow, and a sharp wit, Sarah began owning stages years ago before finally recording her debut full-length solo album in 2013 with Grammy nominated producer and Americana livewire David Mayfield. The result is a gorgeous collection of Americana-tinged songs that touch on pop, jazz, rock, and folk influences. Often fans compare Sarah to the stylings of such great artists as Rickie Lee Jones, Norah Jones, Regina Spektor, Frank Zappa and Lady Gaga. \u201cSarah is full of surprises.

Unfortunately the survivalist and aggressive attitude that was the norm in New York City caused him to be involved in more violent altercations at school, whether it was with other brothers, false flaggers or the relentlessly racist population of an uncultured Middle America. <a href=\"http://viperrecords.com\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://viperrecords.com', 'viperrecords.com');\" target=\"_blank\">viperrecords.com</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"The Sam Bush Band","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/RiRUrR80RcM-sbcvrIgBo-qMSCerc6wug1IVQdZtHD4/mtime:1427987818/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/79133?itok=JWecEXgB\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-10 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://public.ticketbiscuit.com/IsisAsheville/Ticketing/230719","nid":"23302","path":"/show/sam-bush-band","date_group":"2015-04-10 00:00:00","venue":"7316","body":"<p>$30 Advance // $35 Day of Show 5PM Door :: 9PM Show General Admission Standing Show :: Some Balcony Seating Isis is proud to present this special Evening with the</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Villages &amp; Tashi Dorji\u2019s Record Release Show!","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/IP4ZD-j6b5NWJJQneE357b6PVaCk2cX8C8qz9Laa53c/mtime:1427987818/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/deal.jpg?itok=VaO_ke4J\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-10 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23878","path":"/show/villages-tashi-dorji%E2%80%99s-record-release-show","date_group":"2015-04-10 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Come Celebrate the record release for two of Asheville's best experimental musicians!

Sweany has been a mainstay of the roots/blues circuit for several years now. He\u2019s released five critically acclaimed records, toured the US, Canada and Europe dozens of times, and built up a reputation for no-holds-barred, leave-it-on-the-stage live shows that recall the halcyon days of Stax and Muscle Shoals soul revues. His songs are streamed by millions and downloaded by thousands of fans every year, and have appeared in prominent TV and Film spots. He\u2019s toured on his own and in support of artists as diverse as The Black Keys, The Wood Brothers, Wayne Hancock, and The Gourds. Sweany\u2019s newest full-length record \u2013 Close To The Floor \u2013 is as personal a statement as the 38 year old troubadour has ever made. Inspired by tragedy and frustration, it\u2019s a (mostly) gritty look in the mirror for the Akron native who now resides in Nashville. Sweany\u2019s coping with the premature deaths of two family members, his struggles with perpetual touring, and his battles with the ruthless music industry are all examined closely here. Close To The Floor comes out July 16 on Austin label Nine Mile Records. It was produced by Joe McMahan (Luella &amp; The Sun, Allison Moorer, Webb Wilder) in his Wow and Flutter East Nashville studio. Sweany will be touring extensively throughout the summer, including an appearance at The Newport Folk Festival in July. <strong>w/ Joe Fletcher</strong> w/ Joe Fletcher <br> <a href=\"http://joefletchermusic.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://joefletchermusic.com/', 'http://joefletchermusic.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://joefletchermusic.com/</a> <a href=\"http://joefletchermusic.com/\">http://joefletchermusic.com/</a> <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $12 ADV, $15 day of show.

While her previous album was described as \u201chillbilly punk with a honky-tonk heart\u201d (Uncut), this one can\u2019t be so quickly shoehorned into neat categorical cubbyholes. No, things are different this time around\u2014Loveless and her band have collectively dismissed the genre blinders and sonic boundaries that come from playing it from a safe,familiar place.<br> <br> Writing from this new-found place of conviction, Lydia crafted 10 songs that are stark in their honesty, self-examination,and openness. Somewhere Else is more elemental than any of Loveless\u2019s previous material; it\u2019s about longing for the other, whether that\u2019s something emotional, physical, or mental, all anchored by her arresting voice that sounds beyond her years. Creatively speaking, if Indestructible Machine was an all-night bender, Somewhere Else is the forlorn twilight of the next day, when that creeping nostalgia has you looking back for someone, something, or just... anything.\u200b</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Whiskey Shivers</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://whiskeyshivers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/whiskeyshivers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/whiskeyshivers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/WhiskeyShivers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/41/35/69-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Whiskey Shivers\" title=\"Whiskey Shivers\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Born in a woodpile in the twilight months of ought nine, we came from all corners of the US looking to do one thing: to knock the dust off roots music. <br> <br> Upright bass, fiddle, washboard, banjo and guitar; a traditional arrangement for some not so traditional music. <br> <br> Along with our many originals, we breathe new life into old standards, always searching for the true soul of this country's earliest means of hoein' down!

But what you may have missed was the real story behind how The Sun Cans came to be. </p>\n<p>In 2008, brothers Micaiah and Ethan Liner began creating music together. Before then, they never had much in common. In fact, they were, and still are, near polar opposites. Micaiah was the positive, crazy, happy-go-lucky guy, and Ethan was the serious, straightforward, artistic guy. And in many ways their musical tastes were as different as their personalities. Ethan had previously been involved in heavy metal and jazz bands while most of Micaiah\u2019s experience was writing singer/songwriter style music on his beginner level acoustic guitar. Nevertheless, music brought the brothers together. </p>\n<p>More specifically, both brothers became infatuated with the music of the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s. They were amazed at how captivating a 2 minute Beatles song could be and blown away by the tight rhythm sections of bands like The Spinners and Steely Dan. And still by no means identical in their musical tastes, Micaiah and Ethan wanted to create something that was undeniably influenced by the music they had both grown to love. </p>\n<p>This endeavor played out in one band and multiple recording projects before The Sun Cans came into existence. Over the years, the brothers worked to refine their vocal harmonies, to build interesting musical arrangements, and to grow as professional performers. They also learned to appreciate each others differences realizing that it was when they didn\u2019t see eye-to-eye that some of their best work was accomplished.</p>\n<p>The only thing left was to find a band name. After many agonizing months of coming up with names only to trash them, Ethan sat down to a bowl of cereal one morning when \u201cThe Sun Cans\u201d popped into his head. Micaiah felt the name perfectly captured their sound and latched on to it. They were ready. </p>\n<p>After years of persistence, the brothers were on track to create a timeless pop/rock sound. And though the story is far from over, Micaiah and Ethan are confident that listeners everywhere will be totally swept up in the catchy, melodic, and upbeat music of The Sun Cans.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thesuncans.com/\">http://thesuncans.com/</a></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zP5SNzqK48?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Chalwa","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/_fTcsZi7deFasIaN1H65Y4Ir-ZiTwze1zFE0hsOBBfA/mtime:1427987819/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/179977_10151410626631024_1505067282_n_0.jpg?itok=f1jl3Ig0\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/y3QvVPdKcXzaLa-Fr4DSAcr_-fiVfZCO30DTpS8sPLQ/mtime:1427987819/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/179977_10151410626631024_1505067282_n.jpg?itok=ahFOv_V7\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-11 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23575","path":"/show/chalwa-3","date_group":"2015-04-11 00:00:00","venue":"7318","body":"<p>Chalwa is based out of Asheville, NC and plays original High Country Reggae.

Its twelve tracks teem with vivid tales of longing, flight, desperation and redemption, all set in a sonic landscape at once familiar, but also strange and new, like a dream. Without a doubt the culmination of all the group\u2019s best work, VII sounds a lot like America. Blitzen Trapper was founded in Portland, Oregon in 2000 by a group of native Pacific Northwesterners, who played around town endlessly to skeleton crowds and gave away an impressive stream of garage recordings on CDR for years. Then came the Blitzen Trapper record in 2003, and Field Rexx in 2005. But it wasn\u2019t until 2007\u2019s self-released Wild Mountain Nation made a big splash that they finally hit the road, setting the stage for Furr\u2019s release the following year. Powered by its title track and by the G-funk-inflected \u201cBlack River Killer\u201d that record became an unlikely hit and the group suddenly found itself on network television and in glossy magazines and astride colossal festival stages. So they released more music, toured the Western world incessantly, got to work with the likes of Wilco, Stephen Malkmus, Guided By Voices and Belle &amp; Sebastian, and slowly became the band they\u2019d always dreamed they would be. Blitzen Trapper are frontman and songwriter Eric Earley, Marty Marquis, Brian Adrian Koch, Michael Van Pelt and Erik Menteer. VII opens with \u201cFeel The Chill,\u201d a southern adventure complete with a woman in her underwear, deer hunting, and of course drowning at the local bar. Earley takes us down a crooked bend so dark and gloomy you can smell the heat and feel the humidity oppress you. \u201cEach song starts from a small place, a headwater like remembrance and then widens into a song. For instance, that old wreck of a shack buried in evergreen and murky darkness at the bend in the road up on Jackson Hill where we used to drink, never failed to give me a chill driving by in the old Impala for it\u2019s implacable mystery,\u201d Earley notes. Tracks like \u201cThirsty Man\u201d speak of love in a Dylan-esque fashion where Earley reveals \u201clove like rain falls in the wasteland and slips thru the fingers \u2013 for love is a thing that cannot be held, only felt and released.\u201d \u201cDrive On Up\u201d is a soulful, almost bluesy rendition of small town tales of quirkiness. \u201cIt seems you\u2019re always driving on up to something,\u201d Earley amuses, \u201cinto the mountains to see a girlfriend above the reservoir where she lives in a single wide with her mom and a cougar stalks us at fifty yards through the brush, she says to bang sticks but never look it in the eye.\u201d VII moves effortlessly from track to track, allowing Earley to paint the colorful pictures that play in our head while singing along. \u201c\u2026There are those songs I keep writing over and over again, Ever Loved Once with all its regrets and tragic lost love, Don\u2019t be a Stranger its hopeful cousin but they all still point to the same worn out place in the heart of old E. Earley. And hey, we all have that place, that worn spot on the heart like the chew canister circle on the back pocket of blue jeans, or that one shred in the green felt of the table where you ground the stick in too hard\u2026 May these songs minister in ways mysterious and eternal, or at least maybe make you shake a hip.\u201d w/ Spirit Family Reunion <br> <a href=\"http://www.spiritfamilyreunion.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.spiritfamilyreunion.com/', 'http://www.spiritfamilyreunion.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.spiritfamilyreunion.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.spiritfamilyreunion.com/\">http://www.spiritfamilyreunion.com/</a> <br> Spirit Family Reunion is a touring band based out of New York that aims to deliver raw, high-energy honest music.

Sure, the 18-year-old guitar shredder\u2019s talent shimmers with the same resonance as his heroes, but he\u2019s been wielding an axe since he learned to talk \u2013 he started playing when he was 2. Marcus was born into music, gifted with steel-string DNA and two generations of men before him who nurtured the boy\u2019s musical nature. Marcus\u2019s dad, the slyly talented Marvin King, has been a force in Upstate South Carolina\u2019s music heritage for as long as anyone can remember. Marvin\u2019s father and Marcus\u2019s granddad, Bill, played a big part, too. It was only natural, then, that the boy who got his first guitar (a Squier Strat) at age 7 would land his first paying gig a year later. When he was 11, he joined his father\u2019s Marvin King &amp; The Blues Revival to open for Muddy Waters\u2019s onetime bassist Mac Arnold at The Handlebar, the storied venue in their Greenville, S.C., hometown. Around that time, he also played on his dad\u2019s critically acclaimed album, Huge in Europe. And when he was 15, the Marcus King Band opened for the legendary Johnny Winter. MKB\u2019s most recent achievement came with the September 2014 release of Soul InSight. The album\u2019s 12 original tunes, including three instrumentals, showcase a literal lifetime of virtuosity, along with vocals as clear and as soulful as Marvin Gaye\u2019s and as nuanced as Amy Winehouse \u2019s. Adding to all that, Marcus knows jazz. That\u2019s because he built on his Southern-rock foundation with lessons from one of the best instrumentalists around: Steve Watson, the formidable guitarist renowned for his performance on TV\u2019s seminal Hill Street Blues theme song. Marcus still continues to grow, to experiment, to share his passions, although he\u2019s not much of a talker. He lets his guitar do that, using it to tell the same story we all tell, to share emotions we all feel. \u201cI can say more truthfully in song what I can say in words,\u201d he says. \u201cMusic breaks down the awkward barrier.\u201d (For the record, whenever he hears the shopworn \u201cteen angst,\u201d Marcus recoils with the same allergic reaction that he has to \u201cchild prodigy.\u201d) Still, Marcus is the youngest member of his own band. Jack Ryan, 21, plays drums with a musicianship that brings to mind Ginger Baker and Charlie Watts. Bassist Stephen Campbell\u2019s the old man of the trio, a 24-year-old who drives MKB the same way that Garry W. Tallent keeps Bruce Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band on course. Through it all, Marcus gives his mates plenty of breathing room to jam. The result is a fusion of wildly eclectic genres, offering a live experience as mesmerizing as it is dance-inducing. Marcus himself lists an intriguing roster of favorites and influences: Duane Allman, of course, as well as Warren Haynes, Little Feat and Aretha Franklin, to name a few, and his band on any given night plays covers from Bob Marley to Lauryn Hill and from Les McCann to Black Sabbath. That\u2019s Marcus \u2013 an engaged and engaging young man with a lifetime of experience, still coming into his own, still carrying his guitar with him, and promising us all a promising future. <strong>w/ Lionz of Zion</strong> w/ Lionz of Zion <br> <a href=\"http://theloz.bandcamp.com\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://theloz.bandcamp.com', 'theloz.bandcamp.com']);\" target=\"_blank\">theloz.bandcamp.com</a> theloz.bandcamp.com Forming in 2007 The LOZ Band has played everything from coffee shopz to Amitheaterz.

The Tontons simply sound like the Tontons. That sounds like false bluster, but anyone who has been tracking them since 2008 will tell you the same thing. Up front is Asli Omar, that vocal vixen who can make men and rock nerds alike quake in their boots. Bassist Tom Nguyen, whose rumble forms the dermis of the band and then them boys Adam and Justin Martinez come in with titanic guitars and drums to make sure you are still moving your feet. This is a band that has been fully embraced by their native Houston, and the Tontons have hugged the city back with relentless gigging around town, and now it's time for the world to get some love from The Tontons.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Luzius Stone</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://luziusstone.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LuziusStone\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/LuziusStone\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-video-1\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-video-1', 'Video')\" rel=\"nofollow\">Watch</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-audio-1\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-audio-1', 'Audio');\" rel=\"nofollow\">Listen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div id=\"tfly-video-1\" class=\"youtube-playslist-player video\" style=\"display:none;z-index:1008;\">\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" class=\"youtube-player\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mlMLnUSnAFo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-audio-1\" class=\"audio\" style=\"display:none;\">\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/97797535&amp;color=ff5500\"></iframe></div>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/24/66/83-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Luzius Stone\" title=\"Luzius Stone\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">As we move into this new decade of music, Luzius Stone is on the forefront, challenging our ears and minds with a sound that is fresh yet timeless. Emerging onto the scene with a passionate blaze of rhythmic lyrics, beat driven tunes, and a voice that illuminates the sky, Luzius Stone tears down the walls that would threaten to suppress musics\u2019 imagination.<br> <br> Born and raised in a small North Carolina town on the sounds of the Beastie Boys, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, Beck, and Wu-Tang Clan, Luzius Stone knew from a young age that music was rooted within him. Constantly hearing beats and rhythms, he began singing, beat-boxing, and orchestrating songs inside his head. With a very supportive family encouraging him, the dream began. His Father, at the age of three, was severely burned in a house fire, causing years of rigorous surgeries and hardships. He taught him the importance of overcoming life\u2019s obstacles and following dreams. His amazingly supportive mother showed him the importance of living life with integrity and honor.<br> <br> When Luzius was fourteen, his father and mentor died unexpectedly, sending him into a whirlwind of darkness, trusting nothing and no one. His dreams turned into hallucinations, while drugs became an inspiration instead of creating music. Falling deeper into his own twisted reality eventually created a well of experience that he would draw from.<br> <br> Things began to change for Luzius Stone upon entering his twenties. His perception having been altered, his musical interests grown, he began writing and playing songs on an old acoustic guitar his mother had given him. Luzius began mixing aggressive lyrics and chant-like melodies to create a style that he could call his own! He joined a hardcore band, as the front man, to further hone his vocal style and stage presence. With multiple genre\u2019s of music colliding, Luzius Stone had created his unique sound!<br> <br> Having left his home and everything he knew, to pursue his dream, Luzius Stone spent a year in Germany producing his debut release album with co-producer Nicolas Balachandran at Elephantom studios. Exploding with style and passion, the album translates the multilingual voice of music that every human being has the ability to comprehend.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Tuesday Night Funk Jam","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/KUx9wINzOHQ6Icd8v6G0edEG8LpMkv5MupWlLiffm6w/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-1856_149.jpg?itok=QWu073SO\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/63Cg692ARE56bEaC1nyXcOj-Qq7pBb_1fVCpQI7_WDs/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-1856_304.jpg?itok=WAytsoXR\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-14 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23637","path":"/show/tuesday-night-funk-jam-168","date_group":"2015-04-14 00:00:00","venue":"7314","body":"<p><br>\n<p><strong>TUESDAY NIGHT FUNK JAM</strong></p>\n<p>Every Tuesday at Asheville Music Hall.

For Ethan Miller, it has arrived amid catharsis and transformation. The Howlin Rain we thought we knew has evolved, on Miller\u2019s newest, Mansion Songs, into something strange and true and beautiful, a sound made of cigarette ash and swollen moons, salt air and the eggshell light that comes just before the dawn. <br> <br> The result is an album that pines and yearns, lusts and wails. \u201cMeet Me in the Wheat,\u201d \u201cBig Red Moon\u201d and \u201cWild Bush\u201d push the album into high gear, up-tempo jammers that form the yang to the mellow yin of the album\u2019s deep feel ballads. Tracks like \u201cRestless\u201d and \u201cLucy Fairchild\u201d ache like raw wounds or sway like lost, half-sunken ships. \u201cNew Age\u201d is bright and clear-eyed and full of wary joy. \u201cColiseum\u201d prowls, red-veined and hungry - claws out and teeth sharp. <br> <br> Miller is one of those triple threat talents, an endlessly charismatic front man, prolific songwriter and powerhouse lead guitarist. His vocals, writing, and playing are executed with an impassioned fury which verges on religious ecstasy. His music has left a trail of fans in his wake - among them looming names like The Black Crowes, Queens of the Stone Age and iconic music producer Rick Rubin.<br> <br> Mansion Songs is a living, breathing, and thrillingly imperfect thing. It sweats, it bleeds, its skin is rough and calloused. Bringing in a revolving cast of collaborators, musicians he had known and worked with, as well some he had never met, Miller and producer Eric Bauer left it loose and raw, keeping many of the shambling, ragged-at-the-edges, first or second takes. <br> <br> Mansion Songs is Miller and Howlin Rain pushing away the stone and stepping out into the sunlight. It marks next chapters and fresh starts and new roads. In the end Mansion Songs is one of those rare albums made by running with eyes closed and smile wild \u2013 straight into uncharted territory.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Sir Richard Bishop w/ Robert Millis, Shane Parish","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/o6xlvWyM-65-0DvNjc7e8a9t3Wpcdft_18EYBFpA_nk/mtime:1427987820/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/sir-richard_2.jpg?itok=3KHya3ay\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-14 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/772887?utm_medium=bks","nid":"23540","path":"/show/sir-richard-bishop-w-robert-millis-shane-parish-0","date_group":"2015-04-14 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Richard Bishop released his first solo record (Salvador Kali) in 1998 on John Fahey's esteemed Revenant label under the moniker Sir Richard Bishop.

He combines soulfulness and advanced technique with a panache that's nearly unrivaled among today's guitarists. Bishop strums spiritual with incantatory ragas, free-folk excursions, crystalline flamenco flourishes, ruddy Appalachian folk, Middle Eastern-tinged fantasias and gypsy arabesques.

Studebaker, his third studio album released June 4, 2013 by Carnival Recording Company, is propelled by his self-deprecating wit, careful observation, and empathetic ability to make heroes out of outcasts. Recorded in sessions that began late last fall and spilled over into early 2013, Studebaker is a 12-song deep trek, the longest of any of Saenz\u2019s albums thus far.</p>\n<p>Mark Nevers (Lambchop, Bobby Bare, Jr., Andrew Bird) produced Studebaker in his home studio, Beech House Recording, in Nashville. Nevers helped Saenz assemble an ace core cast of players, while Saenz also called on friends including Kenny Vaughan, Pete Finney, Jedd Hughes, Kim Richey, and Bobby Bare, Jr. for cameos. The studio environment was raw and relaxed, prompting Saenz to feel both reinvigorated and nostalgic. \u201cI felt like I was back in Houston or somewhere in Texas, where I recorded my first album,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt far away from Nashville. I\u2019m not knocking Nashville. It was just a nice change for me.\u201d</p>\n<p>While it\u2019s been five years since the release of his critically acclaimed second album Bucket, the path to Studebaker has been even longer. Born in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, Saenz moved to North Carolina at just two months old. Another move in fourth grade took his family to Corpus Christi, where his father, recently retired from the U.S. Army, set up a medical practice. Corpus Christi became home. </p>\n<p>Before pursuing music professionally, Saenz earned an MBA in San Antonio, and when he sighs and tells you the white collar trophy was a nice get but a misguided one, it\u2019s not a humble brag. \u201cI was just kind of lost,\u201d he says. But even after his soft-spoken brushoff, it\u2019s easy to imagine Saenz, who is somehow simultaneously loose and precise, as a top student.</p>\n<p>MBA in hand, Saenz found the call to create music too strong to ignore. When he chose a move to Houston over Austin because his brother set up a studio in the former, he was exposed to another world. \u201cIt was a good time to be a musician in Houston. A lot of us, like Hayes Carll and John Evans, were there together. I was in inner-city Houston, and it was just so cool\u2014huge and unlike anywhere I\u2019d ever lived.\u201d</p>\n<p>The pace, faces, sticky beauty, and musical camaraderie of Houston stayed with Saenz. And while Nashville has surely offered plenty of inspiration, characters and experiences from Corpus Christi and Houston take their turns on Studebaker as well.</p>\n<p>Dabbling in pointed folk, hushed pop, honky tonk, and rock-and-roll, Studebaker combines the acoustic pensiveness of 2005\u2019s Watertown and the full-bodied bravado of 2008\u2019s Bucket. Saenz\u2019s tenor, which has always been arresting, has assumed a full, rich timbre that can still deliver lines delicately, but can also howl like a freight train.</p>\n<p>Saenz\u2019s first two albums were often sharp-eyed studies in wanderlust and self, and while Studebaker picks up the torch, it carries it differently. His need to keep moving is now its own safe haven, and the fluidity or even duality of identity is a salve instead of a threat. </p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been happy, I\u2019ve been sad, I\u2019ve been lucky, I\u2019ve been unlucky. I\u2019ve been spoiled, and I\u2019ve also been whatever the opposite of spoiled is,\u201d Saenz says. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m just getting to the age where I feel more comfortable talking, indirectly, about all of that stuff that most everyone can relate to.\u201d</p>\n<p>As he snarls, \u201cWhere\u2019s my Studebaker / I\u2019m nobody\u2019s pocket change\u201d in new album track \u201cPocket Change,\u201d it\u2019s clear that Saenz is not only comfortable, he\u2019s enjoying himself. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing \u2018Pocket Change\u2019 for a few years now,\u201d he says of the infectious track, which he wrote with Shelly Colvin. \u201cOne of the reasons I decided to call the album \u2018Studebaker\u2019 is people ask at shows, \u2018Hey, what album is that \u201cStudebaker\u201d song on?\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p>In addition to touring heavily, Saenz spent the years between recording Bucket and Studebaker further developing what many already recognized as his greatest strength: his songwriting. A natural solo writer, he stretched by writing with and for an interesting variety of other artists. Saenz co-wrote every track save one on Stoney LaRue\u2019s 2011 album, Velvet\u2014which scored three No. 1 singles on the Texas Music Chart\u2014along with all of the songs on Shelly Colvin\u2019s recently released Up the Hickory, Down the Pine, which features her recording of \u201cPocket Change.\u201d Wade Bowen\u2019s recording of \u201cBottle into Gold,\u201d which he wrote with Saenz, hit No. 1 on the Texas Music Chart. Another Studebaker track will grace another co-writer\u2019s collection: Kim Richey cut \u201cBreakaway Speed\u201d for her new album, Thorn in My Heart. Eli Young Band, Whiskey Myers, and more also joined Saenz\u2019s growing list of collaborators, while others such as Lee Ann Womack have rediscovered and recorded his solo-written work. </p>\n<p>The songwriting on Studebaker shines because Saenz took the time and the chance to evolve. Five co-writers\u2014Richey, Colvin, and Bowen, along with Ryan Beavers and Justyna Kelly\u2014contribute to five songs, while the other seven songs are all Saenz. </p>\n<p>\u201cBreakaway Speed,\u201d co-written with Richey and featuring her harmonies, beautifully chronicles a breakup with a toe-tapping pop melody. Fiddle in tow, \u201cTall Grass\u201d swings through a classic boy-begs-girl-for-a-chance storyline, with a twist. \u201cIt kind of has a criminal element,\u201d Saenz says. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a little of that in me. I\u2019ve never broken the law or been in jail, but I think there is a little bit of that criminal element inside of a lot of people.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cColorado\u201d is an elaborate narrative that transports listeners to John Ford\u2019s West. \u201cHard Time in Tennessee\u201d is a character-defining list of things the hero wishes he could do, but just can\u2019t. \u201cNobody\u201d and \u201cBattle Scar\u201d grapple in different ways with the concept of identity, while \u201cSweet Marie\u201d and \u201cSmiles at the Door\u201d are tender love songs.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe only time I speak out is when I sing,\u201d Saenz says. \u201cI am more comfortable musically now, but in a lot of other ways, too. Maybe that comes through in the songs.\u201d</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mandosaenzmusic.com/\">http://mandosaenzmusic.com/</a></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhEh3NMVvO4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n"},{"node_title":"William Gerhardt","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-04-15 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23212","path":"/show/william-gerhardt","date_group":"2015-04-15 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":null},{"node_title":"Mountain Spirit and Isis present :: Pat Donohue","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/5zJvfOg4gJIyx1YqcG3Fk2NU1B-Y2KKMO5GSYNwv0to/mtime:1427987820/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/78206_0?itok=v1_AOfNf\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-15 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://public.ticketbiscuit.com/IsisAsheville/Ticketing/226356","nid":"23744","path":"/show/mountain-spirit-and-isis-present-pat-donohue","date_group":"2015-04-15 00:00:00","venue":"7316","body":"<p>$15 5PM Door :: 7:00PM Show General Admission Seated Lounge Show :: Limited Tables Available with Dinner Reservation otherwise seating is first come first serve.

The group (consisting of T.J. Childers - Drums, Steven Russell - Guitars, Trey Dalton - Guitars, Mike Paparo - Vocals, Joe Kerkes - Bass) formed in 2006 and released their crushing debut full-length Sundown via Forcefield Records in 2010 to much critical acclaim. Combining a punk rock ethos with an esoteric blend of psychedelia, black metal, and doom/sludge, the quintet quickly developed a name for themselves in the underground through relentless touring and mesmerizing live performances. After Sundown's release, Inter Arma began a rigorous DIY touring schedule, playing shows with bands like Cough, Krallice, Mutant Supremacy, Castevet, Royal Thunder, Ken Mode, The Body, Hull, Batillus, Black Breath and many more. In 2012, the band released a 12\" EP entitled Destroyer via Toxic Assets Records. Based on the strength of this EP they immediately signed to Relapse Records and embarked on a self-booked month long tour. The band excitedly commented, \"It's pretty crazy to think that we'll be tacitly associated with bands like Neurosis, Amorphis, Human Remains, diSEMBOWELMENT, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Incantation, Mastodon, et al. That's a pretty high standard to hold yourself to, but we'll give it our damndest.\" Expect Inter Arma to deliver on their promise.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Jon Spencer Blues Explosion","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/O5MPFg4Je8TGvFCsYEZ0a57_oG5RIrV4g_oOLH5PfyQ/mtime:1427987820/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Jon-Spencer-Blues-Explosion-featured-image_2.jpg?itok=_xLidHXY\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-15 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=2193649","nid":"20508","path":"/show/jon-spencer-blues-explosion","date_group":"2015-04-15 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p><a href=\"http://thejonspencerbluesexplosion.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thejonspencerbluesexplosion.com/', 'http://thejonspencerbluesexplosion.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://thejonspencerbluesexplosion.com/</a> <a href=\"http://thejonspencerbluesexplosion.com/\">http://thejonspencerbluesexplosion.com/</a> <br> <code></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jBXbzIf7qo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jBXbzIf7qo?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <br> New York City is a big place. A loud place. Some of that noise is music. And some of the music is noise. Sucking it all in and turning it loose with prejudice, The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion takes a ferocious bite out of the Big Apple with their new long-player, Freedom Tower \u2013 No Wave Dance Party 2015, the first record of the new era that demands to be stopped and frisked! Like the best sides that percolated up from the Bronx, the Lower East Side, and Greenwich Village across the 1970s and \u201880s \u2013 Freedom Tower is more than a high-octane dance party record, it is a document of New York City, a chronicle of grit and terror and love! It\u2019s all here: The Hustler and The Trust Fund Baby, the Mosh Pit Casualty, the Celebrity Chef, the Crooked Cop, the Struggling Artist, the Sucker MC, the forgotten Sex Workers and Last-Chance Cinderellas. Within these grooves are cold-water tenements, blue-chip galleries, dingy Avenue B studios, and the last real warrior poet whose dark magick brings garage rock ghosts back from the grave! Freedom Tower is a radical portrait of New York City set to the savage funkacide of the Blues Explosion, locked and loaded with the most deadly, predatory guitar riffs that primitive magnetic tape can handle\u2026. From start to finish, Freedom Tower is overmodulated, cooked with dirt, and finished in acid rain! Freedom Tower is packed with the kind of beats and rhymes that will make even the most reserved Walter Mitty jump back and say \u201cdamn!\u201d For nearly a quarter-century the Blues Explosion have been sweating, freezing, eating, drinking, fucking, fighting, winning, and losing in New York City, perpetrating some of the most timeless moments of musical mayhem in the history of Manhattan and beyond. As ever, Jon Spencer tells the tales, Judah Bauer plays the blues, and Russell Simins smashes things to bits\u2026 And as always Blues Explosion stomp on the faux underground oasis peddled by bourgeois hipsters and marketing jocks to deliver the real deal \u2014 rock\u2019n\u2019roll that is unapologetically nasty and strong. Rehearsed and polished in a string of secret gigs and unannounced opening slots in theaters, hotel bars, and dives (often under assumed names), and then recorded at the legendary Daptone House Of Soul in Bushwick and mixed with hip-hop cult legend Alap Momin at the cutting edge of Harlem, Freedom Tower is the most provocative statement of urban pathos and panache ever recorded. Play this record at all-night rent parties, picnics, discotheques, and protests! There are eight million stories in the Naked City \u2014 but there is only one Blues Explosion! Freedom Tower \u2013 dig it now, while you still can! <strong>w/ Bloodshot Bill</strong> w/ Bloodshot Bill <br> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bloodshot-BILL/181873541845773\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bloodshot-BILL/181873541845773', 'https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bloodshot-BILL/181873541845773']);\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bloodshot-BILL/181873541845773</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bloodshot-BILL/181873541845773\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Bloodshot-BILL/181873541845773</a> <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $15 ADV, $18 day of show.

Making the most of their combined voices, a guitar, a drum, and two custom-made stompbox/tambourines, Lowland Hum became known for their enthralling live shows and a songwriting style that moves beyond the genres they inhabit. Illuminated installations and hand-bound lyric books have also made their way into the duo\u2019s live performances, incorporating Lauren\u2019s background in visual art. Their debut album Native Air was released in the fall of 2013 to widespread affirmation, praising the song\u2019s sincere lyrics, sparse arrangements and haunting harmonies. Their follow-up EP, Four Sisters, was released in November of 2014 to similar acclaim. Guitar World described its opening track as being \u201cstarkly beautiful,\u201d and noted that \u201cLovely harmonies interwoven with compelling instrumental lines result in a striking collection.\u201d Though the songs of Lowland Hum began with one acoustic guitar and two voices, many grew in size and scope while the band recorded at a small studio outside Charlottesville, Virginia. Daniel and Lauren enlisted the help of good friends Edd Kerr, Joseph Dickey and Dan Faust (as engineer, bassist and drummer) to allow the songs the kind of expansion they were hearing in their imaginations. Dickey and Faust will join Lowland Hum this spring as the band embarks on a five-week tour, resuming their roles as the supporting rhythm section behind Daniel and Lauren\u2019s vocal-driven live show. The North-Carolina based songwriting duo will release their self-titled sophomore full-length album on April 14. Their new record intertwines folk, indie-rock and americana as a foundation for their entrancing vocal harmonies. <strong>SAM BURCHFIELD</strong> SAM BURCHFIELD <br> <a href=\"http://www.samburchfield.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.samburchfield.com/', 'http://www.samburchfield.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.samburchfield.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.samburchfield.com/\">http://www.samburchfield.com/</a> <br> <code></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dDBWUjJvJzA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $10 ADV, $12 day of show.

The formula starts with drummer Nikki Glaspie (Dumpstaphunk, Beyonc\u00e9)'s deep pocket, explosive energy and silky vocals, compounded by bassist Nate Edgar (John Brown's Body), whose quiet confidence lies in perfect contrast to the emphatic, funky low-end he creates. Next, the unmistakable vocals of Nigel Hall (Lettuce, Warren Haynes Band) and his innate ability to preach with a keyboard hit the groove in full force. Over the top comes Nick Cassarino (Jennifer Hartswick Band, The Shift), oozing more soul in one finger than most guitarists could create in a lifetime, and with a voice that immediately wraps the room in sex appeal. West African djembe master Weedie Braimah (Toubab Krewe, Kreative Pandemonium) is the final X-factor, creating a rhythmic symphony that completes the equation with resounding finesse.<br> <br> Together, The Nth Power wants to change lives through a message of musical love and understanding. \"Just know that when you hear this music, you're going to feel something\u2014you're going to connect with something higher than yourself,\" Braimah explained.<br> <br> The group released an independent EP, Basic Minimum Skills Test, in April 2013 and is currently recording their debut full-length studio album, Abundance, which will be released at the end of the year.<br> <br> \"The sound we create is built on a strong foundation of love,\" said Hall. \"We're just getting started, the best is yet to come.\"</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Cory Henry (of Snarky Puppy)</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.cory-henry.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cory.henry.71\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Cory_Henry\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"bio\">Cory Henry is a multi-instrumentalist and producer with a catalog worthy of a man twice his age. His primary instrument is the organ, and he began playing at the age of two. At the age of six he competed at the Apollo Theater and made it to the finalist round.<br> <br> Henry is primarily known for harmonically rich organ playing that owes a greater debt to the virtuosic unpredictability of Tatum and Peterson than it does to Jimmy Smith and other members of the Hammond organ pantheon. In his best moments he seems to capture the breadth of the Jazz and Gospel idioms and produce something altogether new through his unique blending of the two genres. Although he possesses a great deal of technique, in his solos he regularly subordinates it to a narrative arch and exhibits a maturity that surpasses his years. Unlikely many virtuosos he is a great accompanist, and perhaps this is why he excels also as a producer and sideman.<br> <br> At the tender age of nineteen he had the opportunity to begin traveling with the Jazz legend Kenny Garrett as his organist in a stint that lasted three years. He has done television work playing on the third season of Sunday's Best for BET and on the Jimmy Fallon Show. He has worked with Yolanda Adams, Sara Bareilles, Stanley Brown, Ray Chew And The Crew, P.

Building their songs around powerful three-part harmonies, energetic performances, and a non-traditional way of interpreting traditional American music, The Ghost draws from a broad array of influences including Elmore James and the Beatles, to Tom Waits and more. The Ghost writes powerful songs, built on melody and energy, designed to be performed with passion. From folk to foot-stomping bluegrass, the songs have unique identities while still remaining undeniably the Ghost of Paul Revere. Their live show has quickly attained legendary status, with fans traveling unholy distances from the most remote corners of Maine to catch the band on their way up. The Ghost was formed around childhood friends Max Davis, Sean McCarthy, and Griffin Sherry. They put the Ghost of Paul Revere together in 2011 with Matt Young. In that short time they have played from Fort Kent to New York City in everything from houses, churches, music halls, and even sail boats. Their critically acclaimed debut EP, \u201cNorth\u201d, was recorded in late 2011, released in the summer of 2012, and quickly became one of the best selling local albums in Maine and New Hampshire for 2013. In August 2013, the group went into the studio with Jonathan Wyman to record their first full length album. \u201cBelieve\u201d, released in January 2014 quickly went on to hit the Billboard Northeast chart and continues to be the best selling local album in Maine. A live album of their sold out \u201cBelieve\u201d release party from Port City Music Hall is slated for release in fall 2014.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://ghostofpaulrevere.com/\">http://ghostofpaulrevere.com/</a></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8PtX5QY-FA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Hiss Golden Messenger w/ Natalie Prass","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/CxzrY59DpA75I3kWUfYNXZCWZav0sUL85BHLeHnmhYA/mtime:1423259641/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/hissgoldenmessengerpress_0.jpg?itok=87Dfr0r-\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-16 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/766485?utm_medium=bks","nid":"23538","path":"/show/hiss-golden-messenger-w-natalie-prass-0","date_group":"2015-04-16 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Lateness of Dancers is the fifth full-length from Hiss Golden Messenger. It's an open, confident, immediate album, and it feels, at times, like a direct response to the darkness of M.C. Taylor's last record, 2013's Haw, or to the searching of 2010's Bad Debt, the stunning acoustic LP he made at his kitchen table shortly after the birth of his son. Lateness of Dancers was recorded in a tin-roofed barn outside of Hillsborough, North Carolina, last fall and includes many of Taylor's longtime collaborators, like Phil and Brad Cook of Megafaun, the guitarist William Tyler, and his erstwhile recording partner Scott Hirsch. Alexandra Sauser-Monnig of Mountain Man contributes backing vocals; her tender, wooly voice both complements and challenges Taylor's. The record takes its name from a Eudora Welty story, which is noteworthy not because of its origins\u2014although there are hints of Welty in Taylor's work, and not just Welty but Flannery O'Connor and Faulkner and Barry Hannah and Larry Brown and the whole pantheon of brutal and exquisite southern writers\u2014but because Taylor is the type of person who recognizes the beauty in a phrase like that. It is a record about self-discovery and self-knowledge, and how impossible it is to outsmart yourself. I don't know how you learn a lesson like that, except the hard way. \"The misery of love is a funny thing / The more it hurts / The more you think / You can stand a little pain,\" he sings on \"Mahogany Dread,\" one of Lateness' most telling tracks. These are the kinds of lies we tell ourselves to feel the things we want to feel, even when those pleasures are buried in a whole lot of hurt. Eventually, though, the lies stack up and become blinding, like snowflakes on a windshield. What's a person supposed to do On the swinging, groove-heavy \"I'm a Raven (Shake Children),\" Taylor\u2014now evoking the story of Noah\u2014sings \"Maybe I could see it as a peaceful world\" in a way that indicates to me that, in fact, he probably can't. Still, over and over, Taylor subverts that creeping darkness, turns it into something useful, defines it and defangs it and transforms it; Lateness of Dancers is, against all odds, an optimistic record. I hear so much hopefulness in how he sings the word \"love\" toward the end of \"Day O Day (A Love So Free)\"\u2014I picture him opening his mouth and it just sort of falling out whole, it's that unencumbered\u2014or in the coppery warmth of \"Lucia,\" when Taylor tells us she was beautiful in a way that makes me giddy. It seems unlikely to me that there will be another record this year that does this work, or does it this well. Lateness of Dancers is a deliverance from the self, to the self. From Taylor to us. \u2014Amanda Petrusich, 2014</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Runaway Gin, Machine Funk- Four Sets of Phish and Widespread Panic","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/oghZBtWs6qIcJEDCUoNKDZ5FKKLVJyTmdybZNvsQcUM/mtime:1427987821/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/01-elg_0.jpg?itok=F7cH7KlF\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-17 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/782905","nid":"22333","path":"/show/runaway-gin-machine-funk-four-sets-phish-and-widespread-panic","date_group":"2015-04-17 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":null},{"node_title":"Asheville Ruckus Presents: Carousel Kings &amp; Post Season w/ Post Season, Drosera, Hope Sets Sail, Old Again","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/TQ0ZmMaxMbquETe09jrof3El4OeWtDF98re60xMSHZA/mtime:1427987821/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/75-elg_6.jpg?itok=RkHJOhLc\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-17 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://ashevilleruckus.bigcartel.com/product/ticket-carousel-kings-post-season-drosera-hope-sets-sail-etc-april-17","nid":"22940","path":"/show/asheville-ruckus-presents-carousel-kings-post-season-w-post-season-drosera-hope-sets-sail-old","date_group":"2015-04-17 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Carousel Kings</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.cirecords.com/artists/carouselkings.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/carouselkings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/carouselkings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/crslkngs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/42/04/69-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Carousel Kings\" title=\"Carousel Kings\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">We're a pop-punk band from Lancaster, PA.

They solidified their early friendship based on a mutual love of baseball, comic books, and rock n roll music. They grew up in West Virginia; much time during their high school years was spent on Skull Run Road, where Eric\u2019s family lived, a few miles outside Ravenswood. The boys recall that road as being the site of their first garage band practices. After high school, they started getting a little more serious about their blossoming songwriting partnership. Their road wound through Huntington, WV, and eventually on to Athens, GA, which they soon came to call home. They continued to concentrate on their songwriting, and by the early \u201890s they had a catalogue of over 300 compositions. By this time Hutchens and Carter had given their musical collaboration a \u201cband name\u201d: Bloodkin. People started to notice, and some even started covering some Bloodkin compositions, most notably Widespread Panic, who wound up recording three Bloodkin songs, and who continue to play those and other Bloodkin songs live. Panic\u2019s cover of \u201cCan\u2019t Get High\u201d peaked at #27 on the Billboard AOR charts. Other songs in Panic\u2019s regular rotation are \u201cMakes Sense To Me\u201d, \u201cHenry Parsons Died\u201d, \u201cEnd Of The Show\u201d, \u201cWho Do You Belong To\u201d, and occasionally \u201cQuarter Tank Of Gasoline\u201d. Daniel also wound up playing with ex-Velvet Underground member Moe Tucker in the early-to-mid \u201890s; he played on three of her albums and several of her tours. In 1994 Bloodkin released their first official CD, GOOD LUCK CHARM. The project was produced by Johnny Sandlin (legendary producer of the Allman Brothers, Eddie Hinton, and so many others). Bloodkin recording projects over the years have also featured producers John Keane (R.E.M, Cowboy Junkies, etc.) and David Barbe (Son Volt, Drive By Truckers, etc.). All the while, the Bloodkin boys have continued to play live all over the Southeast and beyond. Daniel and Eric have shared the stage with different lineups throughout Bloodkin\u2019s history, but the last several years have cemented a familiar band: Daniel on vocal and guitar, Eric on guitar and backing vocal, William Tonks on guitar, dobro and backing vocal, Jon Mills on bass, and Aaron Phillips on drums. Recording sessions for the next Bloodkin project will begin in the summer of 2014. Sam is known for his on stage appearances with Widespread Panic and his national touring band Outformation. Sam Holt Band formed in late 2011 after Holt relocated to Colorado. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have these guys in the band. Everyone is a great player, and we listen to each other,\u201d says the transplanted Southerner. Sam Holt was also the long-time guitar-tech for Widespread Panic founding guitarist Michael Houser until Houser\u2019s death in 2002.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"An Evening w/ Same As It Ever Was","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/zLF3m4VbL3HOzPVU2v3krBrGrfyVuxCgh8JJq9fz72k/mtime:1427987821/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/SAIEW.jpg?itok=1bhgS_kC\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-17 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/1341005","nid":"23654","path":"/show/evening-w-same-it-ever-was-0","date_group":"2015-04-17 00:00:00","venue":"7314","body":"<p><br>\n<p>SAME AS IT EVER WAS:</p>\n<p>Love The Talking Heads?

One of the best synopses of Shaver\u2019s upbringing is his own song, \u201cI Been to Georgia on a Fast Train.\u201d When he sings, \u201cmy grandma\u2019s old-age pension is the reason that I\u2019m standing here today,\u201d he ain\u2019t kidding. The \u201cgood Christian raising\u201d and \u201ceighth grade education\u201d \u2014 not to mention being abandoned by his parents shortly after being born, working on his uncles\u2019 farms instead of going to high school, and losing part of his fingers during a job at a sawmill \u2014 are all part of his life story. \u201cI got all my country learning,\u201d he sings, \u201cpicking cotton, raising hell, and bailing hay.\u201d After several trips between Texas andTennessee, he appeared one day in 1968 inBobby Bare\u2018s Nashville office, where he convinced Bare to listen to him play. Bareended up giving him a writing job and soon his songs began to see the light thanks toKris Kristofferson (\u201cGood Christian Soldier\u201d),Tom T. Hall (\u201cWillie the Wandering Gypsy and Me\u201d), Bare (\u201cRide Me Down Easy\u201d), and later,the Allman Brothers (\u201cSweet Mama\u201d) and Elvis Presley (\u201cYou Asked Me To\u201d). Shaver\u2019s real breakthrough, though, came in 1973 whenWaylon Jennings recorded an album composed almost entirely of Shaver\u2019s songs, Honky Tonk Heroes \u2014 largely considered the first true \u201coutlaw\u201d album. Shaver\u2019s own debut album, Old Five and Dimers Like Me, was produced by Kristofferson in 1973. Along with the title track, it contained now-classic Shaver songs \u201cWillie the Wandering Gypsy and Me\u201d and the aforementioned \u201cGeorgia on a Fast Train.\u201d In 1978 Johnny Cash recorded \u201cI\u2019m Just an Old Chunk of Coal (But I\u2019m Gonna Be a Diamond Some Day),\u201d a song Shaver wrote just after he chose to give up drugs and booze and turned to God for help. All Music Guide lists 23 albums, from 1973\u2019s Old Five &amp; Dimers Like Me through 2007\u2019s Everybody\u2019s Brother. Among his many classic songs are \u201cI\u2019m Just an Old Chunk of Coal (But I\u2019m Gonna Be a Diamond Some Day),\u201d \u201cHonky Tonk Heroes,\u201d \u201cGeorgia on a Fast Train,\u201d \u201cLive Forever,\u201d \u201cTramp on Your Street,\u201d and \u201cTry and Try Again.\u201d In 1999, Shaver was invited to perform at theGrand Ole Opry. In 2005, Billy Joe Shaver performed on CMT Outlaws. In 2006, he was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame. He recently served as spiritual advisor to Texas independent gubernatorial candidateKinky Friedman and his 2007 album \u201cEverybody\u2019s Brother\u201d was nominated for a GRAMMY. For his efforts, the Americana Music Association awarded him their Lifetime Achievement Award in Songwriting. Shaver is truly one of the most respected living figures in American music. Bob Dylan, who rarely covers other writers, has often played Billy Joe\u2018s \u201cOld Five And Dimers Like Me\u201d in concert. Johnny Cash called him \u201cmy favorite songwriter.\u201d TheWashington Post noted, \u201cwhen the country outlaws were collecting their holy writings, Billy Joe Shaver was carving out Exodus.\u201d <br> \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014- <br> Legendary Texas outlaw songwriter celebrates upcoming 75th birthday with \u201cthe best album I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d Produced by Ray Kennedy and Gary Nicholson, album features guests Willie Nelson, Leon Russell, Tony Joe White, Shawn Camp, Jedd Hughes, Joel Guzman and more. WACO, Texas \u2014 Billy Joe Shaver\u2019s finest songs prowl (\u201cHard To Be an Outlaw\u201d) and punch (\u201cMusic City USA\u201d) with welterweight fury. Evidence: The legendary outlaw\u2019s seamless Long in the Tooth. Shaver\u2019s first studio album in six years showcases a singular songwriter in absolutely peak form as he unearths his trademark truths around every corner (\u201cLast Call for Alcohol,\u201d \u201cThe Git Go\u201d). \u201cThis is the best album I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s just dangerously good. I expect it to change things and turn things around the way Honky Tonk Heroes did.\u201d Long in the Tooth, set for August 5, 2014 release on Lightning Rod Records through Thirty Tigers, charts his journey as an unrepentant outlaw. \u201cEach song is different with different beats and different kinds of music,\u201d he says. \u201cI even have one rap song. The titles are all so catchy like \u2018It\u2019s Hard to Be an Outlaw\u2019 and \u2018The Git Go.\u2019 Those are pretty hard to beat. Songwriting is gut wrenching, but if you dig down and write real honest you\u2019ll find something real great. I believe everybody should write. It\u2019s the cheapest psychiatrist there is and, God knows, I still need one.\u201d Long in the Tooth spotlights all the highs, lows and in-betweens from Shaver\u2019s storied career, an evolving narrative never short on color. \u201cThe record\u2019s about me,\u201d says Shaver, who turns 75 years old in August. \u201cI\u2019ve written a lot of great songs and I\u2019m still writing great songs, but I felt neglected. I have been, actually. The reluctance to play old people\u2019s music is as bad as it was to play young people\u2019s music. I think it should level out where everyone can hear good art, but it seems like radio doesn\u2019t play older people\u2019s music. Man, it\u2019s like throwing out the Mona Lisa. I don\u2019t understand, but I\u2019m just so proud of Long in the Tooth. This record will be a gigantic step.\u201d Of course, Honky Tonk Heroes was the record that skyrocketed Shaver into public consciousness four decades ago. Waylon Jennings\u2019 landmark album delivered Shaver-written classics practically every measure: \u201cOld Five and Dimers Like Me,\u201d \u201cWilly the Wandering Gypsy and Me,\u201d \u201cRide Me Down Easy,\u201d the title track and the Top 10 hit \u201cYou Asked Me To.\u201d In fact, 10 of the album\u2019s 11 songs were written or co-written by Shaver. It established him as a singular songwriter, a man whose earthy poetry resonates across the board. He\u2019s doubled down ever since. No one sings Shaver\u2019s songs like the man himself, but plenty have tried: Everyone from Johnny Cash (\u201cI\u2019m Just an Old Chunk of Coal\u201d) and Tom T. Hall (\u201cWilly the Wandering Gypsy and Me\u201d) to the Allman Brothers (\u201cSweet Mama\u201d) and Asleep at the Wheel (\u201cWay Down Texas Way\u201d) has cut his tunes. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of like my trophies,\u201d Shaver admits. \u201cInstead of getting CMA Awards, that means a whole lot more to me. When you write songs, and you write good songs, people will always remember you. Words will always outlive us. And if your name is attached to those words, you\u2019re gonna live forever.\u201d Shaver spins yarns linking sacred (\u201cJesus Christ, What a Man\u201d) and secular (\u201cThat\u2019s What She Said Last Night\u201d) with a devil\u2019s grin. High watermarks have become instant standards (\u201cGeorgia on a Fast Train\u201d). \u201cThese days it seems that every young songwriter in Texas wants to grow up to be Billy Joe Shaver,\u201d Kinky Friedman wrote recently. \u201cLike the defenders of the Alamo, I predict that one day they\u2019ll be naming schools after Billy Joe, the man who wrote the immortal lines: \u2018I got a good Christian raisin\u2019/And an eighth grade education/Ain\u2019t no need in y\u2019all treatin\u2019 me this way.\u201d His most wistful (\u201cLive Forever\u201d) and weary (\u201cBlood Is Thicker Than Water\u201d) blur lines between life and art. In fact, Shaver, who lost parts of four fingers in an early sawmill accident, has lived through several tragedies that could serve as blueprints for teary country songs. Most notably, he endured the \u201ccosmic misfortune\u201d of his mother, first wife and only son (guitarist Eddy Shaver) dying within a year of one another. Life\u2019s simply treated him hard. Shaver hasn\u2019t aged gracefully, either. (Spin \u201cWacko from Waco\u201d for his account of shooting a man in the face outside Papa Joe\u2019s Texas Saloon in spring 2007.) The Corsicana, Texas native\u2019s Lone Star State roots run deep: His great-great-great grandfather, Revolutionary War veteran Evan Thomas Watson, was one of the founders of the Republic. Shaver was raised in hardscrabble circumstances by his grandmother, working on farms and selling newspapers on the street in his youth. He sang and made up songs \u201csince I could talk,\u201d and was inspired in his childhood to keep at it after sneaking out of home one night to catch a country music show where he heard Hank Williams early in his career. He drew a connection between country and blues from an uncle\u2019s record collection and the neighboring African-American farm workers\u2019 music. \u201cCountry music is really close to being the blues, and rock \u2019n\u2019 roll ain\u2019t nothing but the blues with a beat. That\u2019s about it,\u201d he says. Shaver was given a Gene Autry guitar by his grandmother at age 11 and began playing until his stepfather gave it away a few years later as payment for yard work. Following a brief stint in the Navy at age 16, a stab at professional rodeo, and the aforementioned incident losing parts of his fingers, Shaver took up playing guitar again and devoted himself to songwriting. He hitchhiked to Nashville in 1965 and eventually earned a $50-a-week writer\u2019s deal with Bobby Bare\u2019s publishing company. Soon Jennings picked up those Shaver classics for Honk Tonk Heroes. As the Washington Post notes, \u201cWhen the country outlaws were collecting their holy writings, Billy Joe Shaver was carving out Exodus.\u201d He followed his debut on the Monument label with three albums on Capricorn Records and two on Columbia through 1987, seeing little commercial success with his recordings but winning rave reviews and the admiration of his musical peers. In 1993, he broke through with new generations and broader audiences as the currently booming Americana and Texas roots music and singer-songwriter scenes were gathering steam with the acclaimed Tramp On Your Street, united with his late guitar-playing son Eddy as simply Shaver. He has since issued 11 more independent albums, was honored with the first Americana Music Award for Lifetime Achievement in Songwriting in 2002, and inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2004. As his well deserved public recognition came in the 1990s, Shaver was cast by his friend and fan Robert Duvall in his acclaimed 1996 film The Apostle, and has since played parts in three other theatrical and TV movies. He was the subject of a 2004 documentary produced by Duvall, A Portrait of Billy Joe, and published his autobiography, Honky Tonk Hero, the following year. He also sings the themes to the Adult Swim television show Squidbillies, and \u201cLive Forever\u201d was included in the award-winning hit movie Crazy Heart as its end-credit song. With these accomplishments behind him, Shaver has been thinking his creative well finally dried up. After all, he hasn\u2019t released an album with new songs in six years. Thankfully, he was wrong. Credit East Nashville\u2019s favorite son with lighting the fire. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I had another hope in the world of doing another studio album,\u201d Shaver says. \u201cThen Todd Snider encouraged me to come up to Nashville and I listened. I knew if I didn\u2019t come out with new songs, it wouldn\u2019t be right. I\u2019ve promised hundreds of critics that I would. So, I just buckled down and got the new songs together. Sure enough, it turned out great.\u201d <strong>w/ Caleb Caudle</strong> w/ Caleb Caudle <br> <a href=\"http://calebcaudle.com\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://calebcaudle.com', 'calebcaudle.com']);\">calebcaudle.com</a> calebcaudle.com <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $17 ADV, $20 day of show.

Deacon moved from self-contained computer music to orchestral epics. His interactive live show, honed in <span class=\"caps\">DIY</span> spaces, was taken to museums and concert halls. He frequently expanded his performances to include a horde of side musicians. Gliss Riffer, an entirely self-produced record of almost all electronic sounds, is a return to Deacon\u2019s Spiderman of the Rings-era process. He calls it \u201ceasily the most fun [he\u2019s] ever had making a record.\u201d After a string of large ensemble projects (including 2009\u2019s Bromst and 2012\u2019s America) Deacon longed for the \u201csimplicity\u201d of the days when he did nearly everything himself. So he made plans to sequester himself in his studio and conjure an album from the sketches and songs he had begun in the back of the van on the European leg of the America tour. Those plans were upended when he received a last-minute invitation to tour with Arcade Fire in August. Rather than lose momentum by pushing back his recording schedule, Deacon continued to make the record on the road. \u201cI was mixing and arranging in the green room before sound check and each night back at the hotel.\u201d Deacon said, \u201cOn days off I\u2019d find a studio to track vocals or mix. When a studio couldn\u2019t be found I dismantled a hotel bathroom, sealing the vents with towels and using all the bedding to turn it into a control room.\u201d This is his first record to showcase his newfound appreciation for his vocal cords, an appreciation he gained after going through an extended bout of laryngitis. \u201cI started thinking about how the voice is an instrument that expires,\u201d he said, \u201cand that made me want to make an album with the voice more exposed.\u201d And that he did. While Gliss Riffer contains all the instrumental layering we\u2019ve come to expect, the vocals are mixed with a prominence (\u201cFeel the Lightning,\u201d \u201cLearning to Relax\u201d) and, at times, a clarity (\u201cWhen I Was Done Dying\u201d) that have never been heard on a Dan Deacon record before. All the vocals are performed by Deacon himself, even the female voice on \u201cFeel the Lightning\u201d is the product of vari-speed recording techniques. This album also marks the first time Deacon replaced his digitally realized parts with analog synthesizers, giving Deacon the opportunity to experiment with synthesizers in the same way he experimented with strings and wind instruments on America. Deacon travelled to Asheville, N.C., to record with Moog\u2019s at-the-time-unreleased Sub 37 analog synth. Gliss Riffer is the first record in the world to feature the instrument. Despite being predominately electronic, Gliss Riffer\u2019s sonic palette is informed by his post-Spiderman material. The Disklavier, a <span class=\"caps\">MIDI</span>-fed player piano first heard on Bromst, is present here. (This time around, Deacon ran it so hard it broke.) Cross-rhythms suggestive of America\u2019s orchestral opus \u201cUSA\u201d and Deacon\u2019s art music work (including a Carnegie Hall performance and film score for Francis Ford Coppola) are also in evidence. What Gliss Riffer shares with Spiderman of the Rings as a musical experience is an aesthetic directness and ecstatic energy. Gliss Riffer trades in exuberant, uncontained fun. Lyrical images of lightning, oceans, lakes, and roads crop up frequently as stand-ins for freedom and self-realization. The tracks were started on the ever-changing landscapes that greet a touring musician. The lyrics, on the other hand, were mostly written in Deacon\u2019s studio, a room with no windows and no air conditioning in Baltimore\u2019s sweltering summer where it was easy to imagine being somewhere else. So while Gliss Riffer is all about fun, it\u2019s figured dramatically. It\u2019s a euphoria tempered by yearning and set in defiance of life\u2019s nagging anxiety. \u201cHappiness takes time,\u201d we are reminded by tremolo vocals in the middle of the supremely danceable \u201cMind on Fire.\u201d The bliss on this record is well-earned.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://dandeacon.com\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://dandeacon.com', 'dandeacon.com');\" target=\"_blank\">dandeacon.com</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"The Mixtape Release Party","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/7J98SsELMWtFX9Vo_1tRCBbWXLPPdXIfKfsks6CIB_I/mtime:1428511885/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/alpha-lee_0.jpg?itok=aDFfnk2n\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-17 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24116","path":"/show/mixtape-release-party","date_group":"2015-04-17 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Martin Snoddy &amp; Alpha Lee Present THE MIXTAPE Release Party Free CD with entry!

His Family was \u201cprofessional hunters\u201d or so you could call them. They had to hunt to eat, and make their knives, bows, &amp; tools out of animal bones, antlers, flint rocks &amp; sticks because they never had the luxury of having much money.</p>\n<p>\u201cPebo was a stubborn, bull-headed kid, he was crazy from the time he could walk\u201d That\u2019s what Pebo\u2019s Dad says about him.<br> \u201cI was always fearless and loved a challenge. If somebody would tell me I couldn\u2019t do something, I would set out to do it, even if it killed me. I loved to prove \u2018em wrong. When it comes to hunting, I guess you could say it runs in my blood, it\u2019s like my drug, it gives me a crazy adrenaline rush that I can\u2019t explain. I snap into a whole other person. The only thing to ever come close to it is my music. The same rush hits me when I\u2019m on stage, \u201cWild-Man\u201d comes out and I use all that energy and try to channel it to my fans. That\u2019s why when you see a Wildman Pebo Wilson show.. You never forget it.\u201d</p>\n<p>So what made Wildman pursue music? In his own words he jokingly said \u201cBecause Chicks dig it!\u201d. He started when he was about 16, and he describes it like this \u201d I would stand up there and watch those beautiful ladies dance to my songs and I was stuck for life, but that was years ago, now it is a way to express myself. I just love it. I can write songs about life and the crazy things that happen to me. For example my song Choctaw Woman, Whoa! Now that is a story! That song was inspired by a one night stand \u2013 Gone Bad! Woman tried to KILL ME! I woke up in my bed and saw her sitting there with a knife to stab me to death! She said if she couldn\u2019t have me then no one would.. but that\u2019s a story for another day.\u201d Wildman was \u2013 Well \u2013 a Wildman back in his early days, and we aren\u2019t just talking about hunting. \u201cIt got so bad that I couldn\u2019t even recognize voices anymore when they would call, I look back and can\u2019t believe that I was ever that man. Then came along Shelly, the girl who changed all of that, the love of my life and the the woman I married who gave me the two biggest blessings a man could ever ask for \u2013 my children.\u201d Poor Shelly didn\u2019t know what she was getting into at first. On their honeymoon Wildman took her on a camping trip \u2013 his way, \u201d He took me way up in the mountains and all I can remember is how it poured the rain so badly that everything we brought washed way down to the bottom of the mountain in a flood! I was terrified and cried \u2018WHAT IN THIS WORLD HAVE YOU DONE TO ME!\u2019. \u201d Shelly describes. She says \u201d Being married to the wildman, all I can say is, there is never a dull moment in our family!\u201d </p>\n<p>Pebo is a true \u201ctrooper\u201d when it comes to overcoming problems, though, you see his family has a history of tumors, and he has over 200 tumors in his body but he keeps going, like nothing is wrong. So how does he keep going? Here is what he has to say, \u201cI always think positive, and never feel sorry for myself. I don\u2019t let anything stop me and I stay active, lots of exercise keeps me from having any pain, life is just too short to sit still and worry.\u201d<br> So be on the lookout for this Wild, Crazy, one-of-a-kind entertainer coming to a venue near you!!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pwwildman.com/\">http://www.pwwildman.com/</a></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITt536aMaM8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>The Outta Luck Band</strong></p>\n<p>Ali Randolph &amp; The Outta Luck Band is based in the mountains of Western North Carolina and play throughout the Southeast.

Since their inception Makayan has been pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a jam band, with long and intricate compositions, complete disregard to the limitations of genre, and a heavy edge that the jam scene has yet to experience. Makayan released their debut studio album \u201cSmile\u201d on March 7, 2014. The album (available on bandcamp) exhibits their wild stylistic range of compositions from pretty acoustic songs with deep lyrical content to metal tinged dance music laced with odd time signatures and lyrics about dog\u2019s tongues and dropping out of college to pursue a rock\u2019n\u2019roll lifestyle. Although they are a relatively young band, Makayan has been reaching out and captivating the minds and bodies of people of all types from all over the region. They are currently voted #1 Jam Band in Western North Carolina by readers of the Mountain Express. Come check them out next time they are in your town!</p>\n<p><strong>Check out a Video: </strong> </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ht9Zh3jypNs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.makayan.net/\">http://www.makayan.net/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Nomadicrage\">Nomadic</a></p>\n<p>Outrageous, unpredictable and intensely captivating, Nomadic is like a roller coaster of sound: soaring peaks and spine tingling drops twisting and turning you through a vast array of musical styles. Nomadic owes its growing success to their highly captivating and energetic live performances as well as their epic and diverse song structures that pull from electronica, blues, funk, progressive and even anthemic rock. These styles all lend to Nomadic\u2019s addictive and undeniably fun grooves, blistering climaxes and melodic ballads that are unique and immense. Nomadic brings an energy packed live sound that is gripping from start to finish. It is an experience not easily forgotten.</p>\n<p>Since their inception in 2010 the quartet has gone from a locally legendary party band to a legitimate up and comer in the region. With each passing year Nomadic\u2019s sound becomes more refined and deliberate, yet they continue to be committed to pushing the boundaries of structure, improvisation and stylistic fusion. They have shared the stage with such east coast powerhouses as The Mantras, Tauk, The Movement, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Dirk Quinn Band, Greenhouse Lounge, Jahman Brahman and many others. The Nomadic name is increasingly commonplace on the regional festival and bar scene and the pack of \u201cNomads\u201d continues to grow.</p>\n<p>2014 has already proven Nomadic\u2019s most successful year to date. The band\u2019s move from Boone to Asheville, NC the previous year presented a new series of challenges that were met with stride. Defining themselves as truly one of the kind in such an established and growing musical climate while building a new local fan base was not easy. Nomadic, however, has emerged more capable than ever before. The group also looks forward to the upcoming release of their debut full length album \u2013 \u201cTrigger\u201d \u2013 a reflection of the environment from which it came. Craggy, tough, spacious and beautiful like the mountains Nomadic call home and a genuine impression of a band on the rise. Trigger is more progressive and complex then their debut EP and is a testament to their continued dedication to their music.</p>\n<p><strong>Check out a video: </strong></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lqJbZSQ8yqg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.nomadicrage.com\">www.nomadicrage.com</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Moe. w/ Kyle Hollingsworth Band","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/xNZlLLoJQW8HBiniO7ls585SeeADkZPPpxmq1seUuBo/mtime:1427987822/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/25-atlg_10.jpg?itok=XoRBoXIj\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-18 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/723311","nid":"22139","path":"/show/moe-w-kyle-hollingsworth-band","date_group":"2015-04-18 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Moe.</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.moe.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/moe\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/moe.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/moeperiod\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/30/51/25-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Moe.\" title=\"Moe.\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">moe. is the preeminent progressive rock band on the music scene today. With 20 years of touring and just as many albums under its belt, the quintet of Al Schnier and Chuck Garvey on guitars and vocals, Rob Derhak on bass and vocals, Jim Loughlin on percussion and vibes, and Vinnie Amico on Drums, continues to push the standard for performance art.<br> <br> Critical acclaim and a solid national and international fan base has built a<br> dedicated following that grows each year. Whether touring across the globe,<br> headlining music festivals, or sharing the stage with such celebrated acts<br> as the Allmans, The Who, or Robert Plant, among others, what keeps moe. at<br> the forefront of the music scene is not only the energy and vitality of<br> their music and songwriting, but the showmanship in which it is delivered.<br> <br> From its humble, inconspicuous beginnings as a local bar band in Buffalo in<br> the late 1980s, to headlining Radio City Music Hall two year's straight on New Year's Eve, moe.'s journey has been one of hard work, perseverance, and<br> dedication. Their music is clever, melodic, refined; their performances are<br> entertaining, mesmerizing and epic. There's a reason that Rolling Stone<br> magazine placed Chuck and Al among the top twenty new \"guitar gods,\" why the pair were featured in Guitar World and Modern Guitar; why Jim and Vinnie have been featured in Drum! magazine; why Rob in Bass Player and State of Mind magazines - all in the same year - because they're that good! <br> Critically acclaimed for its songwriting and studio work, the group's 2001 studio album, DITHER, was awarded four stars by Rolling Stone. 2003's WORMWOOD received four stars by Blender Magazine. Their two latest efforts, THE CONCH and STICKS &amp; STONES, received rave reviews including Rolling Stone, Paste, and Blender magazine. In honor of their 20th Anniversary, the band released SMASH HITS, VOLUME 1. Billed as a \"Young Person's Guide to moe.\", the album features band and fan favorites \u2013 some recast in new recordings that showcase the band's ongoing evolution. \"It's what we and others perceive as our strongest crowd pleasers of the past twenty years,\" Rob muses. \"It's a compilation that you can listen to over and over again. Something your mother might enjoy.\"<br> <br> The band continues to tour extensively: from San Fran to Amsterdam, from Tokyo to Toronto, from Chi Town to Bean Town, from Austin to Atlanta, playing and packing venues large and small, or intimate and grand. Long a featured act at music festivals, they have performed at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, Langerado, and Vegoose, to name a few; yet made time to promote and perform at their own festivals - Summer Camp, Snoe.down, and moe.down.<br> <br> moe. was recently inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame, being recognized not only for the impact they have made in their hometown, but for their charitable work on a national and international level as well. The band hosted a Tsunami Benefit concert at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City on February 10, 2005 and raised $150,000 for Tsunami survivors. The concert earned moe. its second Live Performance of the Year Jammy Award. moe. also raised over $100,000 for various charities, including the Red Cross for Hurricane Katrina survivors and for the music department at Bradley Elementary in Utica, NY, to help keep music in children's lives. <br> <br> moe. kicked off their 20th anniversary in style, hosting a two-night stand in New York City at Roseland Ballroom, which included a special benefit concert for WHY (World Hunger Year) <a href=\"http://www.whyhunger.org/\">http://www.whyhunger.org/</a>. Throughout 2010, moe. continued to bring awareness to World Hunger and other issues, working with Headcount, Freedom for Burma, and many other charities. <br> <br> By all accounts, for this \"legendary jam band,\" as Rolling Stone magazine<br> recently described them, it would be best to keep your eyes on this band and<br> your ears tuned in to their music.

Since then, with a wealth of desire and an abundance of ability, Hollingsworth has established himself as a formidable and versatile music talent, with the ability to contribute, collaborate, compose, and communicate on a number of levels and within a vast spectrum of musical environments. Today, as a member of acclaimed jam masters The String Cheese Incident, Hollingsworth is revered by both peers and fans for his ability to write and perform in a mosaic of styles, from rock to classical, ragtime to bebop. Playing in SCI has allowed him unrestricted access to the world of music, and has bestowed on him the kind of fearlessness a composer needs to flirt with such disparate genres. Those who've seen SCI know that they can jerk from funk to bluegrass on a chord change. \"In the jam world, where there are no set ways of doing things, we're not afraid to move in and out of genres,\" he says, \"and because of that I've learned to be creative, not only onstage but in the studio. I can get on board with something pretty quickly. You have to.\"<br> <br> While his versatility and quick-study nature have become his signature skills with SCI, they have also proved tremendously helpful on stage during collaborations with a bunch of major acts, including Paul Simon, Bruce Hornsby, Bob Weir, Little Feat, and banjo master Bela Fleck. One summer he toured with Phil Lesh in a band that also included Steve Kimock, John Molo, and Warren Haynes. In the summer of 2008 he spent the summer touring with the Mickey Hart Band. This group featured Mickey Hart,George Porter,steve kimock and many others. In another amazing highlight, Kyle also toured with Mike Clark in a band that starred nearly all the original Head Hunters.<br> <br> These gigs prove that Hollingsworth is as unafraid to step out of the limelight as he is to step into it. \"When I play with these performers it's about showcasing them, to support the main role in the best possible way. Seasoned musicians can be tasty and laid back, too!\" Kyle's first solo album release in 2004 reflected his jazz tastes. Titled Never Odd or Even, Joshua Redman and Robert Randolph guested, among others. Never or Odd or Even was the recording Hollingsworth had always wanted to make since he was a kid. In addition to his jazz influences, the album's music demonstrates Kyle's ability to seamlessly fuse genres.<br> <br> His recent release, titled The There's Now, finds the musician coming in to his own. With solid song material and a slamming new band, Kyle is making his mark in the new, always-evolving music scene. Then There's Now delivers a blend of vocal and instrumental tunes and seamlessly displays his growth as a musician and as a songwriter.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"David Dondero w/ Josh Peart, Mother Explosives","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/bkTX8s0g8fAaucrn2UmKo58qek7zh3u7nayRxQWe8go/mtime:1427987821/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/mother-explosives_2.jpg?itok=58c_Hw-R\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-18 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/823449?utm_medium=bks","nid":"23887","path":"/show/david-dondero-w-josh-peart-mother-explosives","date_group":"2015-04-18 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>David Dondero is an American songwriter, guitarist, former lead singer of the band Sunbrain.

The following year, Dondero joined This Bike Is A Pipe Bomb for nearly two years as their drummer. He left in 1998 to focus on his solo material. He has since released seven solo albums \u2013 two with Ghostmeat Records, three with Future Farmer Records and the most recent two with Team Love Records. His eighth album, titled # Zero with a Bullet, was released on August 3, 2010. Dondero has toured with such acts as Crooked Fingers, Jolie Holland, Against Me!, The Mountain Goats, David Bazan, Preston School of Industry, Bright Eyes, Tilly and the Wall, Erik Petersen of Mischief Brew, Spoon, and Willy Mason. Dondero currently resides in Austin, TX.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"The Meadow is Open!

Founding members Chris Caudle (lead guitar) and Cal Comerford (Rhythm Guitar) went to the Garcia memorial in Charlotte\u2019s Freedom Park with acoustic guitars and began playing Grateful Dead tunes. Inspired from the experience, Cal &amp; Chris<br> enlisted college friends John \u201cJohnny D\u201d Dimier (bass guitar) and Rob Armstrong (keyboards) to begin what was to become Wavy Train. The name was taken from the infamous prankster Wavy Gravy and combined with the words \u201c\u2026.we\u2019re riding the Gravy Train.\u201d from the end of Pink Floyd\u2019s Have A Cigar. Tom Stanfel (Drums) and Stefan Hawkins (Percussion) were added in 1996. Our first show was August 9th, 1996 at Morey\u2019s Deli. We were a Grateful Dead cover band, at the start and added shows at Fat Tuesday, Jack Straw\u2019s, and Fat City. In 1997, Chris left Charlotte and Jason Byrd joined the band as lead guitarist, singer and song writer. In 1997, Marcus Farrar (Other People) replaced Tom on Drums. This was the lineup that began to experiment with original music. In 1999 Marcus left for NYC and Ben Speir joined the band on drums. This is the point Wavy Train began to get serious with original music. At the end of 2000, Wavy Train began recording 3 live shows at Visulite Theatre, in Charlotte, which was later released as a full length live album titled One Big Happy Accident. This was their first all original albums and was released in the summer of 2001. During 2001-2002, Wavy Train played from Asheville to DC to Charleston. In 2001, Jason moved to Maryland. In 2011 the band has reunited with new material and Jason Hawthorn on lead guitar and vocals. The band is currently working on a studio album with possible title All The Way Up. They have returned to playing live shows on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"http://reverbnation.com/wavytrain\">http://reverbnation.com/wavytrain</a></p>\n<p>Check out a video: </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RAtZhMz2CA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Dirty Bourbon River Show","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/mExsiVid4fm6ApICj_ihmn_kYdvHNPwuyTtKSY8Lytw/mtime:1427987821/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/DBRS_1.jpg?itok=TaCBIsOx\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/_102bfm7L7YCY3bB8ma2PaL7YuFuoYlxOiIriAkwUGc/mtime:1427987821/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Dirty-Bourbon-featured-image_1.jpg?itok=X2rZfoi8\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-18 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=8874837","nid":"21722","path":"/show/dirty-bourbon-river-show-1","date_group":"2015-04-18 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p><a href=\"http://dirtybourbonrivershow.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://dirtybourbonrivershow.com/', 'http://dirtybourbonrivershow.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://dirtybourbonrivershow.com/</a> <a href=\"http://dirtybourbonrivershow.com/\">http://dirtybourbonrivershow.com/</a> <br> <code></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nY58VG0laBw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <code></code> <br> Less than a year after their homegrown debut, the Dirty Bourbon River Show headlined Tipitina\u2019s on February 5th, 2010, releasing their first full length LP. Showing no signs of slowing down, for their second summer of touring the Dirty Bourbon River Show cut a second 30 min record called Free Love and caravaned around the south \u2013 gypsy style \u2013 giving it out for free. The contagion doubled. That fall they finished up a 6 month burlesque residency as the house band and ringmasters of the Big Busk! \u2013 blending together a unique rock\u2019n\u2019roll comedia er\u00f3tica variety hour heralded by the press as being a \u201cgenetically theatrical love affair.\u201d Additionally, they continued touring the surrounding area \u2013 going as far as North Carolina with the Holy Ghost Tent Revival. The Dirty Bourbon River Show began their third year with the release of a 3rd studio album \u2013 Volume Two \u2013 at the Blue Nile on Frenchmen Street in New Orleans. It was their most ambitious record yet; the already-lush orchestrations of the band began to see even more multi-instrumentalism, large vocal and horn harmonies, and an elevated level of musical interplay between the members. To support its release touring increased\u2026 As spring turned to summer the Dirty Bourbon River Show saw the departure of Wayne Mitchell, leaving the band to pursue a career in biomathematics. New Orleans native Matt Thomas (Kirk Joseph\u2019s Backyard Groove, Something Delicious) replaced him as resident soloist, bringing to the table both tenor and baritone saxophone, along with clarinet and vocals. Now permanently aligned as a full-time professional touring act, Dirty Bourbon spent the 2nd half of 2011 extending the reach of their show further up the Eastern Seaboard and out into the Rocky Mountains. On 11/11/11 they released their 4th studio album \u2013 The Old-Timey AfroPop Jibberish Junction \u2013 attempting to give it away for free again like Free Love. They couldn\u2019t keep enough copies on hand to quell the demands, and it had suddenly become obvious, now more than 200 shows later, that the Dirty Bourbon River Show was becoming something great\u2026 Showing no signs of slowing down, Dirty Bourbon began the year by releasing their 5th studio album, Volume Three. To support it\u2019s release they moved all of their stuff out of the 8th ward and into a storage unit and then took to the road, touring the country for eight straight months. The tour proved extremely successful, solidifying their circuit across the South, Southeast, Midwest, and expanding their reach further into new North Eastern territories. To cap off the year they released their 6th studio album \u2013 The Most Peculiar Thing \u2013 on December 21st at the Blue Nile in New Orleans. The Dirty Bourbon River Show released their 7th studio album \u2013 Volume Four \u2013 in New Orleans on May 25th. Following a four month tour to promote its release (which included high profile appearances at Voodoo Festival Main Stage w/ The Cure, Bristol Rhythm and Roots Reunion, and the 69th Annual Radio and Television Correspondents Dinner in Washington, DC), the Dirty Bourbon boys closed out the year by releasing their 8th studio album \u2013 Accordion Anthology \u2013 on the New Years Eve at the Maison on Frenchmen Street in New Orleans, fulfilling their goal of releasing 2 albums a year for their first four full years as a band. The Dirty Bourbon River Show is taking 2014 by storm, with many high-profile appearances already scheduled, including the 2014 New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. <strong>w/ Hank West &amp; The Smokin Hots</strong> w/ Hank West &amp; The Smokin Hots <br> <a href=\"http://hank-west.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hank-west.com/', 'http://hank-west.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://hank-west.com/</a> <a href=\"http://hank-west.com/\">http://hank-west.com/</a> <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $10.

The band teamed with producer Brian Deck (Iron &amp; Wine, Modest Mouse, Josh Ritter) on Loved Wild Lost and it\u2019s their first time working with an outside collaborator. The result is their most compelling collection of songs to date. The richly layered sound forms the ideal foundation for Bluhm\u2019s soaring vocals and increasingly powerful songcraft. Further color comes from San Francisco\u2019s Magik*Magik Orchestra (Death Cab for Cutie, Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds, The Walkmen), whose complex arrangements serve to amplify the indelibly universal themes of Loved Wild Lost.<br> <br> \u201cLoved Wild Lost is a sincere and sophisticated collection of songs steeped in tradition, but of its own time,\u201d says Nicki Bluhm. \u201cAfter three solid years of playing as a band across the country, we have had time to learn, reflect and grow. This album displays a departure into the deeper and more contemplative themes of people in transition and the struggle to retain the energy and optimism of youth as life becomes more complex.\u201d<br> <br> \u201cThe longer something moves away from its inception point, the more it takes on a life and a narrative of its own,\u201d adds Nicki\u2019s husband and the band\u2019s musical director, Tim Bluhm. \u201cIn these songs, I think you can clearly hear that happening; idealism and optimism losing control to the forces of inertia and a life of constant traveling. Happiness becomes an intention and love becomes a long-term study of oneself and of one another.\u201d</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Andrew Combs</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.andrewcombs.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/andrewcombsmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Andrew-Combs/98371423979\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/andrew_combs\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/45/49/37-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Andrew Combs\" title=\"Andrew Combs\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Andrew Combs is a songwriter, guitarist and singer from Texas who lives in Nashville.

To be recognized as a brand amongst the ever-growing sea of established breweries is nearly a right of passage, as public poll after public poll continues to highlight Asheville and WNC as a must-see destination for entertainment and fine brews. But it was long before this established status that David Quinn, founder of Pisgah Brewing Company, found himself searching for warehouse space to lease in the little town of Black Mountain. Today, Pisgah Brewing Company stands out as a leader in the craft scene of WNC, as it\u2019s flagship Pisgah Pale Ale has been unofficially considered one of the most recognized beers of the region. 2015 marks the 10-year anniversary of serving fine craft brews in Asheville and WNC for Pisgah Brewing Company, and that is reason enough for a multitude of celebrations planned for the year to commemorate the occasion. And what\u2019s a celebration without some serious LIVE MUSIC!!! Sunday, April 19th we embark upon a very special evening with many of the bands we have come to know and love over recent years. Set to perform on this special occasion are: -LEFTOVER SALOMN feat.

Formed in Boulder at the end of 1989, the Colorado slamgrass pioneers took their form of aggressive bluegrass to rock and roll bars at a time when it wasn\u2019t so common, helping Salmon become a pillar of the jam band scene and unwitting architects of the jamgrass genre. Today, Leftover Salmon is: (vocals, acoustic guitar, washboard); (vocals, acoustic and electric mandolin, electric guitar, fiddle); (vocals, acoustic and electric banjo); (vocals, acoustic and electric bass); (drums); (vocals, keyboards). Though the lineup would change through the years, the foundation of Leftover Salmon remained strongly rooted in the relationship between co-founders Emmitt, Herman, and banjoist, , proceeding through a decade of constant growth and nonstop touring. A band whose name carries a certain \u201cje ne sais quois,\u201d the Pimps of Joytime were born out of frontman Brian J\u2019s desire to l Sometimes the stars and planets align and things that can be difficult come surprisingly easy.

Alt-country, neo-soul, indie-jam, Hustle Souls: An exception to the rule, or at least a rare gem. Few bands who access this level of awareness and intention in songwriting also posses the musicality and technical ability to open up and get down and dirty with heaviest of hitters. Unfiltered raw emotion soars from the vocals over brilliantly voiced guitar chords, nashvile pedal-steel and the damn finest rhythm section seen in a long time. This is the band you have been looking for.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Star period Star</span></div>\n<div class=\"bio\">Since forming in Chicago in 1993, Star Period Star (*.*) has been crafting its unique blend of progressive, experimental, post, and pop rock. As the name *.* implies, the band covers the waterfront, not afraid of taking chances with unconventional song structures, and not shying away from a catchy melody either.<br> <br> Their music ranges from heavy to light, simple to complex, major-key inspired happiness to explorations into microtonality. However, you won\u2019t hear a lot of jams in 4/4 from these folks. Some things that appear simple or even sound like mistakes may disguise layers of tightly arranged complexity.<br> <br> After releasing three 7\u201d records on colored vinyl, one improv CD, and two studio CDs, Star Period Star was no more. Then after relocating to Savannah, Georgia, founding member Dan Sweigert reformed the band in 2013.<br> <br> Star Period Star then released its third studio album Can\u2019t See the Forest in 2014 and began playing a series of shows in the Savannah area. This new lineup of the band features Pat Hamilton (Sinister Moustache) on keyboards, guitars, percussion and vocals, Greg Stark (Sinister Moustache) on bass and vocals, Corey Gronner (Elephant Talk) on drums, and Dan Sweigert on guitars, toys, and vocals. Star Period Star is embarking on a 10 state tour this spring playing mostly new material and a couple selections from the earlier albums.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Tuesday Night Funk Jam","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/KUx9wINzOHQ6Icd8v6G0edEG8LpMkv5MupWlLiffm6w/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-1856_149.jpg?itok=QWu073SO\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/63Cg692ARE56bEaC1nyXcOj-Qq7pBb_1fVCpQI7_WDs/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-1856_304.jpg?itok=WAytsoXR\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-21 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23631","path":"/show/tuesday-night-funk-jam-167","date_group":"2015-04-21 00:00:00","venue":"7314","body":"<p><br>\n<p><strong>TUESDAY NIGHT FUNK JAM</strong></p>\n<p>Every Tuesday at Asheville Music Hall.

Unreserved, the five-piece has blown their local music scene away with their powerful blast beats, impossibly quick riffing, and a chick bassist with more balls than all of her male counterparts combined, and now NEUROTIC NOVEMBER has broadened their scope, with their sights set on world domination. <br> Officially beginning their journey in 2009, NEUROTIC NOVEMBER began humbly with Dirty (vocals) posting an ad inquiring about a bassist for his band that had immense potential. Almost immediately his search was fulfilled with the addition of Bear, female bassist who quickly trademarked her aggressive playing style and tough-guy attitude. These two musicians with a dream suffered through multiple line-up changes in order to successfully release their EP Passive May in 2012, which showcased the never-ending energy and exhilarating song structures that began their steady climb to the top of the metal scene. <br> Comprised of vocalist Dirty, bassist Bear, guitarists Yoshii and Nig, and Paiste on drums, the members of NEUROTIC NOVEMBER come from all walks of life and value free-thinking and open-mindedness above all else. Their back-flips, unparalleled conviction, and obvious passion work together to create the unforgettable experience that is seeing NEUROTIC NOVEMBER perform live, and their professionalism breeds spotless musicianship. Ready to take the metal scene by storm, NEUROTIC NOVEMBER is gearing up for a very busy 2014, with plans to tour and meet as many fans as humanly possible. Ready to take the scene by storm, NEUROTIC NOVEMBER proudly presented their label debut studio album, Anunnaki, on October 29th and have been on an upward trajectory since. Revolver Magazine said it best \u2013 NEUROTIC NOVEMBER is \"'Alien' metal worth doing backflips over.\"<br> Stay up to date on the latest news and tour dates as they rise to the top.

Following a brief period of writing and the addition of Hajji Grape on guitar and Chris Swayney on drums the band began playing shows heavily in support of the band's first single \"Ultraviolence\", a song that that captured the attention of the metal crowd an became an icon for the band. In the fall of 2013 the band picked up Ryan Welchel whos stage personality is best represented by his trademark mask and distinct military garb. This inspired Amnesis to take a different approach to their stage presence as the members all currently are represented at live shows by characters which they have manifested into, some wearing masks.

What began as a collection of friends is now a four-year musical partnership about to release their second album. In 2009, Andrew Heringer, Robbie Arnett and Marlana Sheetz began making music together and added Graham Fink into the mix after moving to Los Angeles shortly thereafter. As the group made their cinematic debut album, released in 2012, Milo Greene shifted into a fully tangible being, a force created by four distinct songwriters and musicians whose collaboration consistently remains its center. Last summer, after touring extensively and playing festivals like Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo and Outside Lands in support of Milo Greene, the musicians came home and began writing new music. The band wrote separately, each constructing their own ideas, bringing in varied, individual influences, putting the pieces together as a collective. There was a unified focus on percussion and on creating more up-tempo tracks, specifically ones with rhythmic, dance-inducing grooves. \u201cThe sound has evolved, but this band is the four of us as writers and singers,\u201d Graham notes. \u201cIt\u2019s very centered both on our vocal presences and our identities as writers. We come from different perspectives so that cross-section is what makes us distinct from what we would be as individuals. It\u2019s the sum of the parts thing.\u201d The four songwriters came in with a wealth of material, eventually whittling 17 songs down to the 13 that appear on Control. There was an unintentional through line in the songs as many of the band members were grappling with the end of relationships and with what it means to come of age in a band on the road. The dark, angst-tinged subject matter is juxtaposed with the buoyant sensibility in the music itself, building a dynamic tension between what is said and how it is conveyed. The title of the album represents a spectrum of ideas, reflecting the give and take of control and the shared sense of control within Milo Greene itself. \u201cThe title speaks to the idea of the individual getting out more on this record, whether it\u2019s playing or singing,\u201d Robbie says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we trade and share that control.\u201d \u201cControl is not specific to one thing,\u201d Marlana adds. \u201cTo some, it\u2019s about authority or domination. To others, it\u2019s about having control over your own emotions. The title means something different to each of us.\u201d Throughout the writing process Milo Greene collaborated with several mentors, including drummer Joey Waronker who has worked with Beck and Thom Yorke. Waronker played drums on several tracks on Control and helped guide the rhythms that thread through the songs. The band\u2019s longtime live drummer Curtis Marrero also helped define the rhythmic sounds. The final album was recorded in the spring of 2014 with producer Jesse Shatkin (Sia, Foster The People, Ellie Goulding) at his home studio in Highland Park over the course of two months. \u201cJesse comes from a pop and hip-hop background so he was a good person to help play with what we wanted to do with this music,\u201d Graham says. \u201cHe had a very calming, exploratory effect on us. He really helped balance the four of us and make this record flow.\u201d \u201cWith this album there was a conscious choice to push the sound of Milo Greene in new directions,\u201d Andrew notes. \u201cFour years had gone by since we\u2019d started writing the first album and naturally the music we were drawn toward had shifted as well. We ended up putting a lot of emphasis on the rhythmic foundation of the drums as well as exploring new instruments like synthesizers to fill out the sonic landscape.\u201d In the studio, the musicians wanted to ensure that each singer\u2019s individual voice had its moment. Where the four voices had always combined on Milo Greene, Control reveals each musician alone and how they all come together as one. \u201cOn The Fence,\u201d the album\u2019s debut single, reflects this aesthetic as the singers play off each other over the soaring, propulsive indie pop melody. \u201cWhite Lies\u201d relies on a soulful groove, its surging chorus driven by the song\u2019s percussive elements, while \u201cLie To Me\u201d balances a thumping beat with a lush, orchestral melody. These songs represent a more recent facet of Milo Greene\u2019s ongoing evolution: Control combines the haunting, cinematic expanse of their debut with new, energized elements, urging a more upbeat tone overall. Milo Greene has become something else entirely. \u201cThis feels like a new beginning in some ways,\u201d Robbie says. \u201cWe learned so much on the first album \u2013 about how to tour, about songwriting, about being a band. Now we\u2019ve had these experiences and everything feels like it\u2019s aligning more completely. We\u2019ve grown with our experiences. We\u2019re at a place right now where it feels new and it\u2019s exciting to see the next stage of Milo Greene.\u201d</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Turkuaz- An Earth Day Celebration w/ The Heard, Sumilan","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/bUMLk4HzKpPAaDc-5Mz_oQTSPf6jqFZwbO95ZJLNPvU/mtime:1428511886/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/57-atlg_14.jpg?itok=f8mgLA97\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-22 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/773121","nid":"24037","path":"/show/turkuaz-earth-day-celebration-w-heard-sumilan","date_group":"2015-04-22 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Turkuaz</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://turkuazband.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/turkuaznation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/turkuaznation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/turkuaznation\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/38/95/57-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Turkuaz\" title=\"Turkuaz\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Turkuaz is a 9-piece power funk army hailing from Brooklyn, NY whose modern twist on the classic sound has placed them at the forefront of a new funk evolution. With the obvious influences\u2014Parliament, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, Rick Jamesand Earth, Wind &amp; Fire\u2014as the basis for a recipe, Turkuaz adds healthy doses of jittery, world-pop-dance groove\u2014reminiscent of Remain In Light era Talking Heads\u2014and a passion for Motown and R&amp;B into the mix, resulting in a refreshing twist on the funk idiom that could be described as part freight train and part tyrannosaurus rex.<br> <br> Credible bios are supposed to be objective and not full of superlatives and hyperbole, but it\u2019s hard to avoid gushing when the subject is a group of multi-instrumentals and singers that is who\u2014even on an off night\u2014can blow away a room on the basis of sheer physics alone. Turkuaz certainly does have size in their favor, but when broken down into the basic components, each stands out on their own. Founders Dave Brandwein and Taylor Shell had the cream of the crop to choose from at Berklee, but making it happen as a large touring ensemble takes more than chops: it takes the right blend of personalities. When Turkuaz takes the stage the chemistry is clear. The special combination of elements\u2014singers in sequined dresses, guys in tails (or sometimes all of them in jumpsuits or other complimentary outfits) horns, keys, guitars, amps and drums and smiles all around\u2026 well, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in the explosive auditory and visual circus and find oneself dancing.

Managed by the same team that steers the career of The Avett Brothers, the North Carolina-based Bombadil \u2013 Daniel Michalak (bass, piano, harmonica, vocals), James Phillips (drums, bass, vocals), and Stuart Robinson (piano, ukulele, vocals) \u2013 produced and recorded their new album, Hold On (March 24, 2015/Ramseur Records) over a nine-month period in 2014, scheduling the sessions into the spare moments between tour dates. The album is an amalgamation of rapturous harmonies, sparkling instrumentals, poignant songwriting, and layers of imaginative arrangements that show off the band\u2019s folk roots, but with traces of funk, country, rap, R&amp;B, and New Wave-inspired dance beats. Hold On is an album that surveys the terrain of love with songs full of hope and ironic humor. All three members wrote and sing songs on Hold On, which allowed each to bring his own personality to the mix. \u201cEach of us has different styles so combining them gives us a unique sound,\u201d said Michalak. \u201cI get a lot of my inspiration from books and authors like Ernest Hemingway, Ronald Dahl, or Shel Silverstein\u2026James and Stuart get their inspiration from music, science/math, and computer programming.\u201d Dolph Ramseur, head of Ramseur Records/Management, discovered Bombadil on the band\u2019s MySpace page, caught their live show and signed them in 2006. He helped the group book tours and release records, including the Bombadil EP in 2006, A Buzz, A Buzz in 2008 and Tarpits and Canyonlands in 2009, the record that has often been referred to as \u201cthe album that should have made [Bombadil] famous.\u201d Just prior to its release, Michalak was diagnosed with neural tension, and consequently Bombadil could not tour or promote the record. Bombadil took a hiatus, and after several years of therapy, Michalak was able to return. The band regrouped in North Carolina for 2013\u2019s Metrics of Affection, a release that again received great reviews: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be truly original while still creating catchy pop tunes, and this band manages to do just that\u2026\u201d \u201cBombadil exerts a natural magic for telling tall tales with a splendid tendency towards casual detail.\u201d After an 18 month period of intense touring and songwriting, Bombadil has crafted a record packed with unforgettable melodies, imaginative sonic landscapes, and irresistible harmonies, making Hold On an early highlight of 2015. <strong>DARLINGSIDE</strong> DARLINGSIDE <br> <a href=\"http://www.darlingside.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.darlingside.com/', 'http://www.darlingside.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.darlingside.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.darlingside.com/\">http://www.darlingside.com/</a> <br> <code></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/llcm6imaRVE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <code></code> <br> The Boston based quartet features four distinct voices clustered around a single microphone; their tightly-arranged tunes drawing from the unexpected, including strains of bluegrass, classical, and even barbershop.

Since launching his career in the late \u201990s, the Nashville singer-songwriter has grinded it out on the road, touring through the dead of winter in an RV with no heat; released albums that, while critically acclaimed, didn\u2019t result in the kind of commercial success many predicted; and even stared down an early death, surviving a wicked traffic accident in 2008, an experience that framed his poignant 2009 album The Wreckage. Yet Will has persevered. And that defiant worldview is woven throughout his latest project, Never Give In. Will\u2019s ninth album, Never Give In is a collection of 11 songs, ranging from Stones-y rock \u2019n\u2019 roll to Kristofferson country, that reflects an artist taking stock of where he is as a father, a husband, a man. There is pride in where he\u2019s landed and nostalgia for where he\u2019s been, all of it brought to life by Will\u2019s soulful voice and indefatigable spirit. \u201cIn both my career and personal life, I\u2019ve had a million chances to walk away or quit,\u201d says Will, a married father of two. \u201cBut with this project, there is a sense of pride and ownership that we\u2014the band, our families and our fans\u2014have taken, and that mentality is about never giving in. It represents where we all are, artistically and in our lifestyles.\u201d For Will, he\u2019s standing firmly in the sweet spot. In 2012, he received his first ever No. 1 single, for Eli Young Band\u2019s \u201cEven If It Breaks Your Heart,\u201d a song he co-wrote with Eric Paslay. The song netted Will a Grammy Award nomination for Best Country Song, along with CMA Award and ACM Award nominations, and made him an in-demand songwriter on Music Row. For their No. 1 album Golden, superstar trio Lady Antebellum chose to record Will\u2019s \u201cBetter Off Now (That You\u2019re Gone).\u201d But while Will is enjoying newfound success in country music, Never Give In defies genre classification. Album cuts like the shuffling \u201cStill Got You on My Mind\u201d and the imagery-rich \u201cDaddy Was a Gambling Man\u201d are indisputable country songs, but other tracks would be right at home on rock radio. Album opener \u201cA Different Man\u201d is a hard-charging testament to changing one\u2019s ways, made to sound, Will says, as if \u201cThe Who were from Nashville.\u201d The sneering \u201cHome Is Where the Heart Breaks\u201d recounts an upbringing that is far from idyllic. And \u201cBad Ol\u2019 Days\u201d calls to mind Keith Richards with its chunky guitar riff\u2014and fond recollections of past vices. \u201cI\u2019m a rock \u2019n\u2019 roll guy at heart. That\u2019s just where I come from,\u201d admits Will, who was introduced to rock\u2019s building blocks by his father. \u201cMy dad had grown up with a record collection that was The Beatles, The Stones, Zeppelin, Hank Williams, Otis Redding, Dylan\u2026all of those things. That\u2019s an easy place for me to go, and that\u2019s very natural for me. But I\u2019m lucky that my sound can\u2019t be pigeonholed. Being born and raised in Nashville, I never really saw a dividing line between rock and country. I like the stories each tells, and they\u2019re both a huge part of who I am.\u201d Never Give In excels in its storytelling. The album is remarkable in the concise tautness of its songs, a gift that comes only after years of writing. \u201cThere is a tendency as a songwriter to be verbose and say as much as you can,\u201d Will says. \u201cSome of that comes as a younger songwriter, because you have so much to get out and you haven\u2019t written many songs. But now, having made nine albums, and written a ton of songs in and around town for different people, part of the fun for me is to try to write as minimally and as simply as possible. I want to get more direct with each record and lyrically trim the fat.\u201d \u201cStrong,\u201d Never Give In\u2019s bonus track, is one of the album\u2019s best examples of that lean approach. With lyrics like He\u2019s a need to move something, you can use my truck / He\u2019s an overtime worker when the bills pile up / Everybody knows he ain\u2019t just tough / He\u2019s strong, Will sings about the quiet dedication of the common man in plain language. (The song\u2019s universal message prompted Chevy to adopt \u201cStrong\u201d for its national ad campaign for the Chevy Silverado.) \u201cI think songs are smarter than we are,\u201d Will says. \u201cWe had the record done, finished, and that was it. But I write all the time and came up with \u2018Strong.\u2019 It became its own entity and just had to be included on the album. In some ways, the sentiment of it is exactly what this record is about. \u2018Strong\u2019 could have been the album title as much as Never Give In.\u201d However Will chooses to describe it, that stubborn, never-surrender worldview is paying off. And with Never Give In, Will is poised to further raise a profile that is already reaching lofty heights. Still, he refuses to see this timestamp as his singular moment. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that you have just one shot. I think there are these moments that you have, from whatever powers that be, that give you a tip of the cap or slap on the back and say, \u2018Good work, kid.\u2019 And that keeps you going,\u201d Will says, recounting his recent successes. \u201cI\u2019ve been an underdog for a very long time and a lot of people have wondered, \u2018Why isn\u2019t this bigger or why aren\u2019t more people paying attention?\u2019\u201d he continues. \u201cI never spent much time worrying about the answer to that question. I just wanted to keep writing, keep touring and keep letting it build.\u201d In other words, never\u2014ever\u2014giving in. <strong>w/ Kenny George Band</strong> w/ Kenny George Band <br> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kennygeorgeband\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/kennygeorgeband', 'https://www.facebook.com/kennygeorgeband']);\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/kennygeorgeband</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/kennygeorgeband\">https://www.facebook.com/kennygeorgeband</a> <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $15 ADV, $18 day of show.

For nearly 13 years, they've traveled the USA in a variety of busted automobiles. Their sparse arrangements are both angelic &amp; rusty, using slide guitar, banjo, and a bowed handsaw, all overlaid with the powerful sibling-soul-choir harmonies of Claire &amp; Page Campbell. They are part junkyard orchestra &amp; part campfire song circle. The music is exotic, ethereal, fragile \u2013 full of childlike wonderment. The sisters write songs similarly to how Flannery O'Connor or Cormac McCarthy wrote prose: Barren yet evocative, ethereal and eloquent, built about invigorating imagery, and utterly transfixing. That last one's due in part \u2014 perhaps in whole \u2014 to the Campbell's majestic voices.<br> <br> Over the years Hope For Agoldensummer has released 4 albums &amp; several EPs, most recently working with engineer, Suny Lyons, of Pop Heart Studio. Their tunes have scored several independent films, such as Off The Black (starring Nick Nolte) and D'Artagnan (starring a horse). They most recently toured as opening support for their talented pal, Patterson Hood. They've been the darlings of their hometown for years, consistently winning awards for Best Folk Act, Best Use of Sequins, and Most Likely To East Those Donuts. <br> <br> LISTEN TO OUR LATEST ALBUM: <a href=\"https://hopeforagoldensummer.bandcamp.com/album/life-inside-the-body\">https://hopeforagoldensummer.bandcamp.com/album/life-inside-the-body</a><br> WATCH OUR WACKY VIDEOS: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8BD3DE570FD079C6\">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8BD3DE570FD079C6</a><br> <br> Here's some good press...<br> Relish Magazine :: The instrumentation is spare and unusual \u2013 banjo, bottles, accordion, cello, desk bell, acoustic guitar, slide whistle, clarinet, vibraphone, saw, drums and assorted doodads and noisemakers. The harmonies \u2013 sung by Claire and her sister, Page \u2013 are tight and siren-like. The sound that the band creates is as open and spooky as the sky on a starless night. It is the stuff of moonshine dreams and junkyard symphonies. If Tom Waits were a woman, stoned on peyote, lost in the deep woods and caught in the same scenario as The Blair Witch Project, this is the music that would play. This is dreamy music, hauntingly beautiful, evocatively barren, driven by poetic narratives that flit between story-song and stimulating imagery. It is transfixing and engaging, slow and gentle. Time stands still.<br> NPR's All Songs Considered Blog :: Hope For Agoldensummer has a knack for crafting gorgeous and often complex refrains, supported by utterly captivating arrangements. When it comes down to it, the lilting, alto voices of the Campbell sisters bolster Hope For Agoldensummer's sincere folk aesthetic. The group can craft folk songs that are truly unique and compelling, which can't be said for so many bands, in a genre that so often produces formulaic, one-dimensional tunes.<br> Resonator Magazine :: This is music that's definitively southern, definitely rural, and reminiscent of a folk-art angel singing her heart out\u2026 the territory tread by Hope For Agoldensummer is equal parts Cormac McCarthy and Flannery O'Connor with weaponry provided by Nick Cave-the sort of songs that hold knives behind their backs, lingering in sweetness just long enough to unveil the darkness lingering 'neath\u2026<br> Leicester Bangs :: This family band is almost too much (in a very positive way, obviously), and their music beguiles me. Listening to Hours [In The Attic] made me realize what a privilege it can be to see and listen to real artists, in an environment where the songs can reach out and wrap themselves around you so very tightly, and make the rest of the world disappear, whilst the magic of the music lingers on. The music is at once absorbing, beautiful, classic, delightful, eloquent. I shall stop here before I have covered the whole alphabet; I'm sure you get the picture. This is a must-have album, and I don't say that about many live ones.<br> Independent Weekly :: Hope for Agoldensummer puts the Southern soul of Page and Claire Campbell in rustic, ramshackle settings\u2014call it impressionistic Americana.<br> Philadelphia City Paper :: Claire and Page Campbell sing about God and heartbreak like they're drunk on their own glorious harmonies and have all the time in the world.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Resonant Rogues</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"https://www.theresonantrogues.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theresonantrogues\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"bio\">The Resonant Rogues team up with Hank West &amp; the Smokin' Hots for their Kickstarter Countdown.<br> <br> The Resonant Rogues play old-fashioned originals influenced by Gypsy Jazz, Eastern European, and American folk.

Managed by the same team that steers the career of The Avett Brothers, the North Carolina-based Bombadil \u2013 Daniel Michalak (bass, piano, harmonica, vocals), James Phillips (drums, bass, vocals), and Stuart Robinson (piano, ukulele, vocals) \u2013 produced and recorded their new album, Hold On (March 24, 2015/Ramseur Records) over a nine-month period in 2014, scheduling the sessions into the spare moments between tour dates. The album is an amalgamation of rapturous harmonies, sparkling instrumentals, poignant songwriting, and layers of imaginative arrangements that show off the band\u2019s folk roots, but with traces of funk, country, rap, R&amp;B, and New Wave-inspired dance beats. Hold On is an album that surveys the terrain of love with songs full of hope and ironic humor. All three members wrote and sing songs on Hold On, which allowed each to bring his own personality to the mix. \u201cEach of us has different styles so combining them gives us a unique sound,\u201d said Michalak. \u201cI get a lot of my inspiration from books and authors like Ernest Hemingway, Ronald Dahl, or Shel Silverstein\u2026James and Stuart get their inspiration from music, science/math, and computer programming.\u201d Dolph Ramseur, head of Ramseur Records/Management, discovered Bombadil on the band\u2019s MySpace page, caught their live show and signed them in 2006. He helped the group book tours and release records, including the Bombadil EP in 2006, A Buzz, A Buzz in 2008 and Tarpits and Canyonlands in 2009, the record that has often been referred to as \u201cthe album that should have made [Bombadil] famous.\u201d Just prior to its release, Michalak was diagnosed with neural tension, and consequently Bombadil could not tour or promote the record. Bombadil took a hiatus, and after several years of therapy, Michalak was able to return. The band regrouped in North Carolina for 2013\u2019s Metrics of Affection, a release that again received great reviews: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be truly original while still creating catchy pop tunes, and this band manages to do just that\u2026\u201d \u201cBombadil exerts a natural magic for telling tall tales with a splendid tendency towards casual detail.\u201d After an 18 month period of intense touring and songwriting, Bombadil has crafted a record packed with unforgettable melodies, imaginative sonic landscapes, and irresistible harmonies, making Hold On an early highlight of 2015. <strong>DARLINGSIDE</strong> DARLINGSIDE <br> <a href=\"http://www.darlingside.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.darlingside.com/', 'http://www.darlingside.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.darlingside.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.darlingside.com/\">http://www.darlingside.com/</a> <br> <code></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/llcm6imaRVE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <code></code> <br> The Boston based quartet features four distinct voices clustered around a single microphone; their tightly-arranged tunes drawing from the unexpected, including strains of bluegrass, classical, and even barbershop.

After a spring and summer of exciting audiences across the world, the Lips embarked on a month-long fall tour of the Middle East. They were tailed by Georgia rock-doc royalty Bill Cody, of Athens, GA - Inside/Out fame, who filmed the band playing for Egypt who had just overthrown their government, kids in Iraq who barely have a government, and kids in Dubai who finally get to see a band that isn't in the top 40. As Cody assembled his footage into the feature Kids Like You and Me, the band returned home from the New Year's maelstrom and began settling into album mode. <br> Recording for Underneath the Rainbow was split between New York with Thomas Brenneck, who was recommended by Arabia Mountain producer Mark Ronson, and Nashville with the the Black Keys' Patrick Carney, who offered to help produce in a Mexico city hotel room just before dawn. <br> <br> \"It was one of those super-late-night/super-early-morning drunk-talk sort of situations, so we weren't sure if he meant it,\" explains Jared. \"People do that all the time.\"<br> <br> Early internet conjecture pegged Underneath the Rainbow's sound as a blend of southern rock with throwback C&amp;W and blues, based on the lead single 'Boys in the Wood', which is a weird description for a record containing the first Black Lips' song with a prominent synth (\"Funny\"), and even less apt for an overall album that owes just as much to the kiwi pop of New Zealand's South Island and the Chicago South Side's Crucial Conflict as it does the standard American South. It never strays far from the traditional roots music that has always found a comfortable home with the Black Lips, but invites enough curiosity with its approach to attract even the most unlikely listener.<br> <br> 'Underneath the Rainbow' can only guarantee one thing; that the kids will be Smiling, Waiting for the Dandelion Dust to make things Funny at the Dorner Party while the Boys in the Wood Make You Mine as they Do the Vibrate.

Although still \"underground\" in many respects, the band has earned high praise from critical stalwarts like the BBC, Village Voice, Guardian, and Boston Herald, and has performed at some of the best venues and festivals in Asia, Europe, Australia, and North America.<br> <br> The band has always used live performance as its chief form of evangelism, and maintains a more intense tour schedule than almost any band in the idiom. Over the course of 2013, Snarky Puppy will give almost 200 performances and workshops on four continents, including North Sea Jazz, Monterey Jazz Festival, Jazz \u00e1 Vienne, Blue Note Tokyo, and the Melbourne International Jazz Festival. The band's 2012 release, the live DVD/CD \"GroundUP,\" reached #14 on the Billboard Jazz Charts and #3 on the ITunes Jazz Charts in 2012, topped only by Grammy winners Robert Glasper and Esperanza Spalding. Their 2013 release \"Family Diner, Vol. 1\" debuted at #1 on the iTunes Jazz Chart in the US, Canada, UK and New Zealand and was in the top 5 in a handful of other countries. It stayed in or around the top spot for almost 2 months and the lead single \" Something\" featuring the powerful vocals of Lalah Hathaway has over 1.6 Million views on YouTube.<br> <br> Snarky Puppy seamlessly fuses a deep knowledge and respect for musical tradition with sonic and conceptual innovation in a way that is able to reach the most critical- or most carefree- audience. The convergence of musicians from white and black America (who also perform regularly with artists like Erykah Badu, Snoop Dogg, Kirk Franklin, Justin Timberlake, Roy Hargrove, and Marcus Miller among others), which occurred while the band was in its adolescence at the University of North Texas, has naturally established a system of balance that instantly draws listeners to the music- raw funk and sensitive dynamics, relentless pocket and lyrical melodicism, lush harmony and soulful simplicity, and most importantly, a delicate mixture of composition and improvisation.<br> <br> The group is led by award-winning bassist/guitarist/composer/arranger Michael League, whose creative grass-roots approach to a tougher-than-ever industry has created a new model for independent artists. Snarky Puppy is a three-headed creature: first, and most obviously- an original music ensemble. Second- a production team and session band for individual artists. Third, and probably most importantly- Snarky Puppy is a group of musicians enthusiastically committed to music education and community outreach. Working with groups like ROAM (Roots Of American Music) in inner city Cleveland and the Music Lab at Jefferson Center in Roanoke, as well as giving clinics at hundreds of colleges, high schools, and middle schools worldwide, the band has made a strong commitment to spreading their love of music and general positivity to a young generation looking for something real to be inspired by.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">RJD2</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-3\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://rjselectricalconnections.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/rjd2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/RJD2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Rjd2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-3', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/03/55-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"RJD2\" title=\"RJD2\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">The major labels are crumbling. The deficit soars. Your neighbor came home with SARS. Teenage youth are more armed than Ted Nugent. There will never, ever, be a new episode of \"Friends\". Clay out-sold Reuben. Odds are you are about to enter another four years of Bush-brand terror. Not to worry, though. Rjd2 has a new album.<br> On his breakout solo debut, Deadringer, Rjd2 sent listeners on a musical foray into instrumentalism, feasting on styles both old and new, and in the process creating a sound that's emerging as one of the most interesting and exciting new voices in instrumental music. In a genre filled with ambient spacemen and droning techno fromage, Rjd2 brought a sense of song structure and vitality that was sorely missing, harkening back to a time when instrumental groups like Booker T. and the MG s got radio play (no joke). And the accolades rolled in. From industry luminaries like Chris Blackwell, to members of Radiohead and The Strokes, to ?uestlove of The Roots (who nominated Dead Ringer for the prestigious Short List awards in 2003), to DJ Shadow, Rj soon became a favorite of those in-the-know. Dead Ringer was an incredible success globally, appearing on many a year-end list, including Spin's Top 40 Albums of 2002. In '03, he followed up the success of his debut with The Horror, an EP of B-sides that played closer to an entirely new album than a collection of leftovers, and cemented Rjd2 as one of music's most talked about new artists. Touring from Japan to Amsterdam, Rj caught wreck with a dizzying 4-turntable reconstruction/reconfiguring/reinterpretation of the album for fans worldwide, sharing the stage with the likes of DJ Shadow, El-P &amp; the Def Jux crew, David Lynch, The Roots and Prefuse 73, amongst others.<br> -------<br> While Rj soon became the name to drop in hipster circles, he made his bones in the underground, playing a major role in that mid-west power surge better know as Columbus hip hop. After setting it off in 1998 with the mighty Mhz crew on Bobbito Garcia's legendary Fondle Em Records, he caught the attention of El- P and in 2000, he locked in with the Definitive Jux camp, and soon after made his DJX debut on Def Jux Presents I, co-starring with Company Flow, Cannibal Ox and Aesop Rock. Then came the now classic \"Good Times\" white label 12-inch, and the rest has been indie hip hop history. Over the past few years, Rj's profile as a producer has grown immensely as he's clocked time on the boards producing or remixing Mos Def, Massive Attack, El-P, Aceyalone, Polyphonic Spree, Elbow, Cannibal Ox, and others, wielding a versatility rarely seen in music today. His prolific nature has brought him the unique accolade of 'freelance producer/remixer extraordinaire' in Urb Magazine's Best of 2003<br> issue, amongst others. As one half of the duo Soul Position, he's the ultimate team player, taking a back seat to his MC, Blueprint, and letting him do the talking, while RJ's music keeps the heads nodding. Their 8 Million Stories LP was received in 2003 to rave reviews and continues to nod, and turn, heads. ---------<br> 2004 brings a new, self-titled album, a more focused and cohesive effort than Dead Ringer, while still maintaining the vitality and soulfulness that made his debut so enjoyable. Like a modern day Quincy Jones in the abstract, RJ truly orchestrated his new record, creating a multitude of new songs from all angles, writing music and lyrics, arranging vocals and melodies, auditioning singers and even experimenting with a vocoder. He cut out any fat or filler, and in an industry virtually afloat on the concept of the guest appearance, the album features none (well, maybe one). It's strength instead lies in the meticulous programming, lush instrumentation and solid song arrangements. In many ways, an artist's sophomore album is when their true colors are shown (or exposed), and when their real career begins (or begins to end). In the words of Jimmy Castor, it s just begun.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Slow Magic</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-4\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.slowmagicmusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/slowwmagic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/SlowwwMagic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-4\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-4', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/03/57-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Slow Magic\" title=\"Slow Magic\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Slow Magic is music by your imaginary friend.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">The Fritz</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-5\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.thefritzmusic.com/home.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theFRITZmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/thefritzmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-5\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-5', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/68/01-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"The Fritz\" title=\"The Fritz\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Infectious grooves, intoxicating guitar lines and a relentless drive of soul and passion describes one of the Southeast's newest sensations, The Fritz.

Jamar Woods' virtuosic keyboard solos and soulful vocal abilities propel the band into exciting musical journeys that are accented by his powerful stage presence. Rounding out the group is percussionist Mike Evans. His taste for world music, power funk and the occasional rap on the mic give the band a truly one-of-a-kind sound that is unmatched.<br> <br> After their move to the North Carolina in 2011, the band has grown into a full time touring juggernaut that thrives in the live setting.

Last February, the band spent time at Crooked Tree Studios recording their second full-length album.

The album is the band's most fully-realized effort to date, a culmination of years of experimentation, personal growth, deepening friendship and an unrelenting exploration of melody, beats and words.<br> <br> The band has played with the likes of Toro y Moi, Black Moth Super Rainbow, Prefuse 73, Nite Jewel, Lazer Sword, Mount Kimbie, Tanlines, MillionYoung, The Sounds, Marley Carroll, Foreign Exchange, Otto Von Schirach, Polyphonic &amp; Serengeti and Foxy Shazam. They have also performed at Miami's Winter Music Conference, Hopscotch Festival 2012 and Moogfest 2010 &amp; 2012.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Kansas Bible Company</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-8\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.kansasbiblecompany.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kansas-Bible-Company/155867204434052\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/kansasbibleco\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-8\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-8', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/03/87-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Kansas Bible Company\" title=\"Kansas Bible Company\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">The Kansas Bible Company is 12 man wrecking ball of sound featuring a five-man horn line, three guitars, two percussionists, one bass, and keys.

Experience the family of TUATHA DEA!!!</p>\n<p>Tuatha Dea is a Gaelic phrase adopted from the Celtic mythology of the Tuatha de Danaan whose literary history originates in Ireland and Great Britain. The name \u201cTuatha Dea\u201d literally translates into \u201cChildren of The Gods\u201d. The band\u2019s Celtic influence stems directly from this historical clan which lived and ruled for a period in ancient Ireland and who were later destined to become the stuff of legend and basis of Celtic mythology. Those who dwelt beneath the burrows.

One became six, a collective of musicians by trade, lovers by spirit. Inspired by a life worth living, the Fam and Pals remained rooted with three ambitions in heart, mind, and soul: the people, the music, the memories.

The vocal ranges echo the myriad of instrumental textures, accompanying death and hope filled lyrics, weaving in and out of spiritual survival and thriving. But, though there are many seemingly different elements that make up who the Collection is, the sound is a unified one, the sound of a family with a common name; And that\u2019s what the Collection is and invites us to be \u2013 a big family. <strong>support TBA</strong> support TBA <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $12 ADV, $15 day of show.

The Austin, TX singer songwriter has made a habit of defying expectations so the piano-driven \u201cBright Beginnings\u201d and the atmospheric rumination of \u201cGreat Hosannas\u201d are just further indication that he\u2019s quite comfortable stepping outside of the guy-with-a-guitar trappings of the genre. His rise has been as improbable as it has been impressive. After dropping out of college and taking on work as a carpenter in Chicago, he got his musical start by providing CDs for his fans to pass along to their friends. This led to a string of sold out shows and a record deal with Nashville indie Lightning Rod Records (Jason Isbell, Billy Joe Shaver). As he toured behind \u201cMessenger\u201d (2010) and The Great Despiser (2012) it was with a band that looked as much like a jazz trio as an Americana band. \u201dI never quite found a live band that captured what I was aiming for until I connected with Greg [Tuohey\u2013electric guitar] and Matt [Schuessler\u2013upright bass]. It was an arrangement that maybe didn\u2019t make a ton of sense on paper but 10 minutes into the first rehearsal I knew this was going to be my band.\u201d The following years would have them on the road for over four hundred shows, including stops at Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo, and The Newport Folk Festival. The relentless grind of four years of nonstop touring had taken its toll though, and by late 2013 he was ready to call it quits. The tour that fall was a runaway success but his personal and creative lives were a different story. \u201dIt was this surreal dichotomy. Everyone kept congratulating me on how well the tour was going, and the mood was probably the best it had ever been on the road. We finally got two hotel rooms in each city instead of one. We\u2019ve got this incredible group of die-hard fans that somehow make each show bigger than our previous trip through town. Meanwhile my relationship was in shambles and creatively I was at a dead end. There was absolutely no joy left in playing music. So we walked off stage after a particular show when I played terribly, and pulled my manager aside in the green room and told him to cancel the rest of the tour dates and that I was essentially through.\u201d But studio time was already scheduled and deadlines had been set for a new record, so after a few weeks Pug was back to the business of writing songs. \u201cIn retrospect, I was in a very unhealthy place. I was sitting in a room with the blinds shut and a notebook, forcing out words that weren\u2019t there and drinking astonishing amounts of bourbon. I was looking at it as a job\u2026.as a business obligation, and that is a very slippery slope.\u201d At that point he decided to make good on his promise from the previous tour. The album was put on indefinite hold. \u201cI just needed to start behaving like a human being again. I needed to reconnect with my girlfriend. I needed to eat healthy food. I needed to go enjoy live music as a fan. I really needed to make sure I still loved making music, because I really had my doubts at that point.\u201d The resulting layoff paid dividends in spades. When Pug set up camp in Lexington KY in 2014 to record, he did so with some of the best songs he has ever written. The agenda was much simpler than previous albums. \u201cThe aim on this one was very straightforward. We wanted to capture the music just the way we play it, with minimal production. It was a very back to basics approach because ultimately that\u2019s what I love about music, and that\u2019s what I love about making music. I wanted to record these songs the way they were written and put them out in the world.\u201d The result is a collection of songs that are as close as we\u2019ve gotten to a road map to Pug\u2019s ambitions. He has collected plenty of the requisite Dylan comparisons over his young career but on this record it\u2019s easier to hear the sway of more contemporary influences like Josh Ritter, Ryan Adams and M.Ward. The theme of resilience plays a central role throughout Windfall. The weary protagonist in \u201cVeteran Fighter\u201d wills his way further down the highway despite the gloom that seems certain to overtake him. \u201dThe Measure\u201d, a song inspired in part by Frederic Buechner\u2019s novel Godric, marvels at \u201devery inch of anguish, laid out side by side\u201d but ultimately finds that \u201cAll we\u2019ve lost is nothing to what we\u2019ve found.\u201d \u201dI never really write songs with a specific narrative in mind,\u201d Pug explains. \u201cWhen you\u2019re sort of pushing through a dark period of your life it\u2019s probably inevitable that some of that is going to find its way onto the page. But in the same way, by the time we were in the studio the process had become very effortless and joyful. And hopefully you can hear a lot of that on the record as well.\u201d This duality appears perhaps most overtly in the album-closing stunner \u201cIf Still It Can\u2019t Be Found\u201d, which features Pat Sansone of Wilco guesting on mellotron. If it\u2019s not around this corner it\u2019s around the next <br> If it\u2019s not beyond this river it\u2019s beyond the next <br> And if still it can\u2019t be found <br> It\u2019s prob\u2019ly for the best As the saying goes, \u201cAll\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d Joe Pug didn\u2019t call it quits after all. He\u2019s engaged to be married and still drinks bourbon on occasion. His new album, Windfall, will be released March 10, 2015 on Lightning Rod Records in the US and Loose Music in Europe. <strong>w/ Field Report (solo)</strong> w/ Field Report (solo) <br> <a href=\"http://fieldreport.bandcamp.com/releases\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://fieldreport.bandcamp.com/releases', 'http://fieldreport.bandcamp.com/releases']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://fieldreport.bandcamp.com/releases</a> <a href=\"http://fieldreport.bandcamp.com/releases\">http://fieldreport.bandcamp.com/releases</a> <br> \u201cField Report\u201d is an anagram of Chris\u2019s last name (Porterfield).

The deficit soars. Your neighbor came home with SARS. Teenage youth are more armed than Ted Nugent. There will never, ever, be a new episode of \"Friends\". Clay out-sold Reuben. Odds are you are about to enter another four years of Bush-brand terror. Not to worry, though. Rjd2 has a new album.<br> On his breakout solo debut, Deadringer, Rjd2 sent listeners on a musical foray into instrumentalism, feasting on styles both old and new, and in the process creating a sound that's emerging as one of the most interesting and exciting new voices in instrumental music. In a genre filled with ambient spacemen and droning techno fromage, Rjd2 brought a sense of song structure and vitality that was sorely missing, harkening back to a time when instrumental groups like Booker T. and the MG s got radio play (no joke). And the accolades rolled in. From industry luminaries like Chris Blackwell, to members of Radiohead and The Strokes, to ?uestlove of The Roots (who nominated Dead Ringer for the prestigious Short List awards in 2003), to DJ Shadow, Rj soon became a favorite of those in-the-know. Dead Ringer was an incredible success globally, appearing on many a year-end list, including Spin's Top 40 Albums of 2002. In '03, he followed up the success of his debut with The Horror, an EP of B-sides that played closer to an entirely new album than a collection of leftovers, and cemented Rjd2 as one of music's most talked about new artists. Touring from Japan to Amsterdam, Rj caught wreck with a dizzying 4-turntable reconstruction/reconfiguring/reinterpretation of the album for fans worldwide, sharing the stage with the likes of DJ Shadow, El-P &amp; the Def Jux crew, David Lynch, The Roots and Prefuse 73, amongst others.<br> -------<br> While Rj soon became the name to drop in hipster circles, he made his bones in the underground, playing a major role in that mid-west power surge better know as Columbus hip hop. After setting it off in 1998 with the mighty Mhz crew on Bobbito Garcia's legendary Fondle Em Records, he caught the attention of El- P and in 2000, he locked in with the Definitive Jux camp, and soon after made his DJX debut on Def Jux Presents I, co-starring with Company Flow, Cannibal Ox and Aesop Rock. Then came the now classic \"Good Times\" white label 12-inch, and the rest has been indie hip hop history. Over the past few years, Rj's profile as a producer has grown immensely as he's clocked time on the boards producing or remixing Mos Def, Massive Attack, El-P, Aceyalone, Polyphonic Spree, Elbow, Cannibal Ox, and others, wielding a versatility rarely seen in music today. His prolific nature has brought him the unique accolade of 'freelance producer/remixer extraordinaire' in Urb Magazine's Best of 2003<br> issue, amongst others. As one half of the duo Soul Position, he's the ultimate team player, taking a back seat to his MC, Blueprint, and letting him do the talking, while RJ's music keeps the heads nodding. Their 8 Million Stories LP was received in 2003 to rave reviews and continues to nod, and turn, heads. ---------<br> 2004 brings a new, self-titled album, a more focused and cohesive effort than Dead Ringer, while still maintaining the vitality and soulfulness that made his debut so enjoyable. Like a modern day Quincy Jones in the abstract, RJ truly orchestrated his new record, creating a multitude of new songs from all angles, writing music and lyrics, arranging vocals and melodies, auditioning singers and even experimenting with a vocoder. He cut out any fat or filler, and in an industry virtually afloat on the concept of the guest appearance, the album features none (well, maybe one). It's strength instead lies in the meticulous programming, lush instrumentation and solid song arrangements. In many ways, an artist's sophomore album is when their true colors are shown (or exposed), and when their real career begins (or begins to end). In the words of Jimmy Castor, it s just begun.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Slow Magic</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.slowmagicmusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/slowwmagic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/SlowwwMagic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/37/03/57-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Slow Magic\" title=\"Slow Magic\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Slow Magic is music by your imaginary friend.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">RBTS WIN</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-3\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://rbtswin.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RBTSWIN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/RBTSWIN\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-3', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"bio\">RBTS WIN is a sample-based/psych-pop production duo heavily influenced by the sounds of soul and R&amp;B.

Although still \"underground\" in many respects, the band has earned high praise from critical stalwarts like the BBC, Village Voice, Guardian, and Boston Herald, and has performed at some of the best venues and festivals in Asia, Europe, Australia, and North America.<br> <br> The band has always used live performance as its chief form of evangelism, and maintains a more intense tour schedule than almost any band in the idiom. Over the course of 2013, Snarky Puppy will give almost 200 performances and workshops on four continents, including North Sea Jazz, Monterey Jazz Festival, Jazz \u00e1 Vienne, Blue Note Tokyo, and the Melbourne International Jazz Festival. The band's 2012 release, the live DVD/CD \"GroundUP,\" reached #14 on the Billboard Jazz Charts and #3 on the ITunes Jazz Charts in 2012, topped only by Grammy winners Robert Glasper and Esperanza Spalding. Their 2013 release \"Family Diner, Vol. 1\" debuted at #1 on the iTunes Jazz Chart in the US, Canada, UK and New Zealand and was in the top 5 in a handful of other countries. It stayed in or around the top spot for almost 2 months and the lead single \" Something\" featuring the powerful vocals of Lalah Hathaway has over 1.6 Million views on YouTube.<br> <br> Snarky Puppy seamlessly fuses a deep knowledge and respect for musical tradition with sonic and conceptual innovation in a way that is able to reach the most critical- or most carefree- audience. The convergence of musicians from white and black America (who also perform regularly with artists like Erykah Badu, Snoop Dogg, Kirk Franklin, Justin Timberlake, Roy Hargrove, and Marcus Miller among others), which occurred while the band was in its adolescence at the University of North Texas, has naturally established a system of balance that instantly draws listeners to the music- raw funk and sensitive dynamics, relentless pocket and lyrical melodicism, lush harmony and soulful simplicity, and most importantly, a delicate mixture of composition and improvisation.<br> <br> The group is led by award-winning bassist/guitarist/composer/arranger Michael League, whose creative grass-roots approach to a tougher-than-ever industry has created a new model for independent artists. Snarky Puppy is a three-headed creature: first, and most obviously- an original music ensemble. Second- a production team and session band for individual artists. Third, and probably most importantly- Snarky Puppy is a group of musicians enthusiastically committed to music education and community outreach. Working with groups like ROAM (Roots Of American Music) in inner city Cleveland and the Music Lab at Jefferson Center in Roanoke, as well as giving clinics at hundreds of colleges, high schools, and middle schools worldwide, the band has made a strong commitment to spreading their love of music and general positivity to a young generation looking for something real to be inspired by.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">The Fritz</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.thefritzmusic.com/home.cfm\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/theFRITZmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/thefritzmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/68/01-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"The Fritz\" title=\"The Fritz\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Infectious grooves, intoxicating guitar lines and a relentless drive of soul and passion describes one of the Southeast's newest sensations, The Fritz.

Armed with an arsenal of original funk rock tunes, the band is known for packing houses full of eager dancers ready to follow them into the morning. For those that have caught a show (or a dozen) in the past year, there is no question as to why the band has quickly become one of the most sought-after groups in Bozeman. The tunes are fun, the vibe is fresh and the band is overflowing with talented musicians.\"<br> <br> \"What more could you ask for?\" asks Bozeman Daily Chronicle Arts Editor, Rachel Hergett.<br> <br> The band's dedication to working hard and continuously writing high-caliber music has pushed them to the top of the stack amongst Montana's touring music scene. Their sound has evolved since the band's inception, now featuring a progressive funk sound that underpins their irresistible fusion of genres. Unstoppable rock'n'roll energy seamlessly integrates with a jazz musicality that makes their raucous dance party an equally engaging listening experience. <br> <br> Now they're taking their explosive and innovative sound on the road to venues and festivals across the country, drawing diverse and energetic crowds at every turn. There's no telling where the band will wind up next, but you can be sure it will be on a big stage in a city or college town near you.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Brandy Clark","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/G2eLV2AG1eS7rs89JGCMVJubc2uvk63Ltk4FksruUSI/mtime:1427987824/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/BrandyClark_McClister_5031-2.jpeg?itok=qXv0BVSP\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-26 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=6234204&partner_id=240","nid":"23664","path":"/show/brandy-clark-0","date_group":"2015-04-26 00:00:00","venue":"7311","body":"<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/plPRmANJF_w?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>When your grandmother enlists you to model her \u201cI Skied Down Mount St. Helens May 18, 1980\u201d t-shirts\u2014complete with \u201cauthentic\u201d burn holes\u2014at the local flea market, you can be sure you\u2019re going to grow up with a unique outlook on life.

The band formed in 2014 with the creation of singer/songwriter Matt Townsend's debut LP \"Matt Townsend and the Wonder of the World\" (June 2014; Eternal Mind Records, <a href=\"http://www.matttownsendmusic.bandcamp.com\">www.matttownsendmusic.bandcamp.com</a>) With songs that \"connect universally while remaining personally vulnerable\" and Influences ranging from Bob Dylan, Townes Van Zandt and Neil Young to Neutral Milk Hotel, Modest Mouse and Radiohead, the band creates an eclectic blend of folk-inspired modern music. Matt Townsend (b.1987) began writing songs in secret around 2008 for no purpose other than to satisfy an insatiable need to write them. Though the songs seemingly appeared out of nothing, in the years since he has written hundreds of compositions and began performing in 2010. Initially busking on the streets of Burlington, VT and playing local coffeehouses, he soon began gracing the stages of clubs and venues around the Burlington area. His first solo EP \"What Light Shall Be\" was released in November 2012. In 2013, shortly after recording the album \"Matt Townsend and the Wonder of the World\" he abruptly left Burlington, VT, and found himself in Asheville, NC, knowing virtually nobody, and not entirely sure why or how he got there. He met a few musicians, showed them the album he'd been making in Burlington, and a new incarnation of Matt Townsend and the Wonder of the World was born.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"contra dance","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-04-27 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"21546","path":"/show/contra-dance-121","date_group":"2015-04-27 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p>Contra Dance in Asheville Monday nights from 8pm-10:30pm, featuring our great local callers and bands as well as nationally touring talent.

The theatrical metal-n'-roll vaudevillian visionaries have infiltrated Rock Radio and the hearts and minds of those thirsty for creative innovation, inescapable melodic hooks and a sense of dangerous revelry all wrapped up in deliciously subversive hit songs.<br> <br> The eleven tracks on HAIL THE APOCALYPSE join a rich catalog filled with cred-building artistic peaks and commercial breakthroughs alike, following in the tradition of larger-than-life bands like Rammstein, System of a Down and Rob Zombie who have conquered the airwaves without sacrificing their brilliant uniqueness and unfettered expressionism. Working from the playbook of Alice Cooper, Kiss and like minded phantoms of rock, Avatar delivers a postmodern party, electrifying the mainstream and underground alike.<br> <br> Produced by longtime collaborator and two-time Grammy nominee Tobias Lindell, mixed by Jay Ruston, and mastered by Paul Logus. Hail the Apocalypse serves as ample evidence why Avatar is welcomed at Download UK, Rock on the Range and on tour with rock radio hitmakers, like label mates Pop Evil.<br> <br> \"Bloody Angel\" and \"Hail the Apocalypse\" are new anthems for the ages, precision heat-seeking missiles targeting a cultural landscape primed and ready for fresh songs to champion from a band with a giant persona to rally behind. Breaking into America on tour with Sevendust, conquering their native Europe in arenas with Avenged Sevenfold and Five Finger Death Punch, Avatar shocked the world with the Top 30 commercial rock radio success of \"Smells Like a Freakshow\" and \"Let it Burn.\"<br> <br> Nobody was more amazed when Avatar devilishly polluted the commercial airwaves with their last album, Black Waltz, than band cofounder Johannes Eckerstr\u00f6m. \"Sweden is a smaller country. In terms of airplay, there isn't much room for heavier stuff and we aren't typical radio material. So, to me, with all due respect, isn't radio where you go to hear Lady Gaga songs? To hear we were Top 30 in America, it was like, 'Say what?!'\"<br> <br> Avatar puts equal emphasis on their visual presentation, stage presence and overall creative coherence, giving fans more than a killer live show and hit songs. Avatar is a work of art.<br> <br> Hail the Apocalypse was recorded live at Karma Sound Studios in Bang Saray, Thailand. Bands like Bullet For My Valentine have made records there, enveloped in a trippy/exotic locale not unlike Killing Joke making a record inside an Egyptian pyramid back in the day. The band then went on to Tobias Lindells' studio in Patong, also in Thailand to record vocals and guitar solos. The studio is located in a house owned by a horror movie buff that includes a swimming pool decorated like Castle Grayskull.<br> <br> The plane ride over inspired an unexpected turn in the creation of Hail the Apocalypse. After they had become sufficiently buzzed from the plane's bar, the band synched up their video screens to take in \"Sound City,\" Dave Grohl's documentary love letter to the famed studio where seminal albums from the likes of Nirvana, Metallica, and Slipknot were made.<br> <br> \"After the documentary was over, we looked at each other and said, 'We should totally record this album live.' We were planning to do it in a more modern way, track-by-track, to a click track. But we said, 'Screw it! Let's do this live, the old-fashioned studio way.'\"<br> <br> Avatar didn't see much sunlight while in Thailand, opting instead to put their collective nose to the grindstone and work hard on what has become a hard rock masterpiece.<br> <br> \"The band was in a room staring at each other instead of staring at the floor. It was a great experience. Our producer rents a house from a guy who is a big horror movie fanatic. So when I did my vocals, I had big statues of Leatherface and Predator starring me down. And then there was that skull fountain in the pool! It was the perfecting setting. Here we were in this tropical environment, and yet death was everywhere.\"<br> <br> Black Waltz began a momentous climb for Avatar both in terms of their career and in terms of their evolving sound. Hail the Apocalypse follows suit, building on the strengths of the last album while blowing down the doors off even the highest of expectations.<br> <br> \"When we did that music video for the title track on the last album, that's where we came up with the face paint and everything around it,\" the band's frontman explains.<br> <br> \"Something really clicked on a much deeper plane than we expected when I got my face paint. I saw myself in the mirror and I was awakened. We've been riding on that ever since. It's hard to even put it into words. We've played together for ten years; we've started to evolve a certain groove together, while still rooted in extreme metal.\"<br> <br> Avatar came together at a young age, wrapping their heads around the New Wave of Swedish Death Metal that surrounded them in their native country and sharpening their chops. In short order, the technical melodic death metal of Thoughts of No Tomorrow (2006) and the even more intense Schlacht (2007) gave way to the classic rock n' roll and traditional heavy metal style of their self-titled third album, which demonstrated Avatar's ability to craft catchy songs with memorable hooks was equal to their technical proficiency. The group toured with metal luminaries In Flames, Dark Tranquility and Helloween, among others, as they steadily built a profile in the worldwide underground.<br> <br> The ensuing word of mouth success around Black Waltz brought an increasingly diverse swath of newcomers to Avatar's shows, as they toured the U.S. supporting gold-selling rockers Sevendust and fellow Europeans Lacuna Coil. That tour included the band's first ever casino gig. \"We had always said, if we ever play in a casino, we are going to take the payment for the show and put it on red at the roulette table,\" Eckerstr\u00f6m says, laughing. \"We finally got an opportunity to do that and guess what? We actually won!\"<br> <br> The string of good fortune continues, as Avatar gears up to conquer the world with Hail the Apocalypse. The virtuoso side of their earliest rumblings remains intact, enhanced with momentous strength by songwriting chops, gigantic hooks and a sense of groove. Hail the Apocalypse is not only the best album in the Avatar catalog, it's one of the most diverse hard rock records of the modern age, catapulting Avatar above the pack.<br> <br> Avatar's music is challenging, daring, but altogether captivating, boasting Charlie Chaplin's winking silent movie flair for the dramatic and Marilyn Manson's dark merging of the commercial and the macabre, but still rooted in heavy music for its own sake.<br> <br> \"We are doing something that I strongly feel is lacking,\" Eckerstr\u00f6m says. \"This is metal music made by metal heads for metal heads. It's honest, intense and full of integrity.\"</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Amnesis</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.reverbnation.com/amnesis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amnesisband\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/31/20/51-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Amnesis\" title=\"Amnesis\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Formed in the fall of 2011, Amnesis was rooted by the common interests of reunited guitarist Jason Miller and Frontman Jaysun Brenneman, with hopes of bringing something different to the local scene. After a few lineup changes and the constant evolution of the sound they desired Amnesis began playing shows in the spring of 2012, afterwhich they released an independent EP entitled \"Sick is the New Sane\". Following a brief period of writing and the addition of Hajji Grape on guitar and Chris Swayney on drums the band began playing shows heavily in support of the band's first single \"Ultraviolence\", a song that that captured the attention of the metal crowd an became an icon for the band. In the fall of 2013 the band picked up Ryan Welchel whos stage personality is best represented by his trademark mask and distinct military garb. This inspired Amnesis to take a different approach to their stage presence as the members all currently are represented at live shows by characters which they have manifested into, some wearing masks. Amnesis is currently a regional act and are playing shows in the Southeastern United States while finishing their first independently released full-length</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Severance</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-3\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.reverbnation.com/SeveranceMusicPage\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Severance/122294591189284?sk=timeline\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/SeveranceMusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-3', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"bio\">What can we say, we love music, its what we are really and truly passionate about.

He is a banjo picker. A fiddle hummer. A song singer. The music he plays, creates, and performs is the music that carried all of us, from all over the world, to the place (wherever that place may be) we are now. He plays the American landscape, the one he himself sees and experiences. He goes about it with the only tools necessary, as any good craftsman would. A man not competing with time, only living in his own. From California, USA, Frank sings tunes he has worked hard to collect from around the world as well as his own well-dusted ditties. His eclectic sets feature soaring hillbilly ballads, arcane rambling songs and murder ballads delivered in a reedy tenor with that irresistible American Primitive quality. He cut his teeth as a street performer in LA and has the raw intensity and quick-fingered technique to make your hairs stand on end. Loved by many he has toured with Cass McCombs, Fleet Foxes, Charlie Parr and released on his own Pawn imprint plus Jack White\u2018s Third Man records and Tompkins Square. His latest touring adventures have seen him storming OFF Festival in Poland with fiddling accomplice Zac Sokolow, as well as embarking on a string of UK dates with Richard Dawson. <br> <em><br> \u201cA young Californian who sings and plays as someone who\u2019s crawled out of the Virginia mountains carrying familiar songs that in his hands sound forgotten: broken lines, a dissonant drone, the fiddle or the banjo all percussion, every rising moment louder than the one before it.\u201d</em> <br> \u201cA young Californian who sings and plays as someone who\u2019s crawled out of the Virginia mountains carrying familiar songs that in his hands sound forgotten: broken lines, a dissonant drone, the fiddle or the banjo all percussion, every rising moment louder than the one before it.\u201d \u2013 <strong>Greil Marcus</strong> Greil Marcus <br> <em><br> \u201cOne of America\u2019s best conduits of antiquity\u201d</em> <br> \u201cOne of America\u2019s best conduits of antiquity\u201d \u2013 <strong>Pitchfork</strong> Pitchfork <strong>w/ Sarah Louise</strong> w/ Sarah Louise <br> <a href=\"https://sarahlouise.bandcamp.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://sarahlouise.bandcamp.com/', 'https://sarahlouise.bandcamp.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">https://sarahlouise.bandcamp.com/</a> <a href=\"https://sarahlouise.bandcamp.com/\">https://sarahlouise.bandcamp.com/</a> <strong>and The Carolina Cud Chewers</strong> and The Carolina Cud Chewers <br> <code></p>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsqtsjaMngI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsqtsjaMngI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $10 ADV, $12 day of show.

And their new album So Delicious elevates the trio\u2019s work to a new level. Produced by Rev. Peyton, So Delicious offers the band\u2019s most diverse collection of songs buoyed by the Rev.\u2019s supercharged six-string virtuosity \u2014 a unique style of fingerpicking inspired by his Delta blues heroes, but taken to new, original heights. The fifth full-length original album by the group \u2014 which includes Breezy Peyton on washboard and supporting vocals and Ben Bussell on drums and supporting vocals \u2014 is their debut on Yazoo Records, a label known for the historic reissues of blues and other old time American music that are the bedrock inspiration for the Rev.\u2019s sound and approach. \u201cYazoo was my favorite record label growing up,\u201d he explains. \u201cFor fans of old country blues and all manner of early American music, they are the quintessential label. And for me, it\u2019s like being on the same label as Charley Patton and \u2018Mississippi\u2019 John Hurt. To think that Yazoo believes we are authentic enough to stand with the other people in their catalog means a lot.\u201d The Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band has always been strong on authenticity, playing music that blends blues, ragtime, folk, country and other traditional styles with the sleek modern energy of do-it-yourself, homespun, punk fueled rock. And performing tunes plucked from their lives, their community or from the canonical songbook that fed the Rev. Peyton\u2019s formative creative identity. It\u2019s a mix that\u2019s allowed the band to win fans from all corners of the Americana and rock worlds, and bring a new generation to blues and other forms of American roots music. <br> So Delicious is a perfect Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band album, with songs that speak from the heart and capture the trio \u2014 whose sound has been honed over 250 annual tour dates during the last eight years \u2014 playing at their peak. The charging, anthemic \u201cRaise a Little Hell,\u201d also the set\u2019s first video, lays out the band\u2019s live modus operandi, thriving on Bussell\u2019s and Breezy\u2019s chugging beat and the Rev.\u2019s resonator guitar riffs and mantra-like singing. The song was inspired by a show at a folk festival, where one of the promoters \u2014 struck by the Big Damn Band\u2019s raucous, juke joint power \u2014 told the Rev., \u201cY\u2019all sure raise a lot of hell.\u201d \u201cI said, \u2018Naw we don\u2019t,\u2019 \u201c the Rev. recalls. \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018Well, maybe we do raise a little hell.\u2019 \u201c <br> The sweet, joyful \u201cPot Roast &amp; Kisses,\u201d which the band has also committed to video, was written for Breezy. The Rev. was developing the finger-busting main riff after enjoying one of her pot roast dinners when the lyrics naturally fell into place. \u201cSome people don\u2019t believe that we really live the way we sing about in our songs,\u201d he explains, \u201cbut it\u2019s true. Breezy and me are together and really love each other. We try to keep things simple, like people have in Brown County, Indiana for a long time. And we really do live in the woods and forage for some of our food \u2014 like I sing about in \u2018Pickin\u2019 Paw Paws\u2019 on this album.\u201d Some listeners also have a hard time believing all of the Rev.\u2019s extraordinary guitar performances are recorded live with no overdubs \u2014 until they see the Big Damn Band in concert. \u201cPot Roast &amp; Kisses\u201d is a radiant example of his nimble style, weaving two melodies, thumb plucked bass lines and bright decorative filigrees into a graceful, upbeat blend. The rocking electric juggernaut \u201cLet\u2019s Jump a Train\u201d is another. The song\u2019s lyrics explore the notion of courageously pursuing adventure \u2014 a frequent theme in the lives and the songs of the Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band \u2014 while the Rev. bangs out a machine-gun rhythm with his thumb, ladles in generously sinuous licks and tosses off seemingly effortless fills and accents, then solos and plays the beat simultaneously. \u201cI\u2019ve been obsessed with the idea of taking fingerstyle guitar to a place it\u2019s never been before,\u201d the Rev. says. And he\u2019s gotten there by blending the foundational playing of great country bluesmen like Charley Patton and John Hurt with the early-rock vigor of Chuck Berry and the licks played by old timey fiddle players who recorded in the 1920s and \u201930s. In fact, that school of fiddle \u2014 enshrined in Yazoo\u2019s catalog \u2014 is often reflected in the Rev.\u2019s slide playing, which adds to the uniqueness of his virtuosity. As producer, the Rev. adopted a strategy that let the Big Damn Band\u2019s strengths shine on So Delicious. Bussell\u2019s drums were pared down to the essentials to showcase the Rev.\u2019s guitar and ebullient singing, and to allow the beefy melodies on the 11 songs to flex their muscles. Plus Breezy and Bussell deliver their strongest harmony singing, with Breezy in particular elevating numbers like the workingman\u2019s ode \u201cDirt\u201d with her soaring voice. The Rev\u2019s fascination with country blues began at the age of 12, when he started dipping into his father\u2019s album collection and his dad brought a beaten Kay guitar into the Peytons\u2019 Indiana home. In addition to mirroring the guitar playing he heard on recordings of early blues artists like Robert Johnson and Patton \u2014 who the Rev. paid tribute to with 2011\u2019s solo acoustic Peyton On Patton \u2014 he also started assimilating more modern recordings from Muddy Waters\u2019 Chess Records catalog and blues-rock players like Johnny Winter. Those recordings often featured multiple guitar players and overdubs, but Peyton blended all the six-string lines he heard into one fluid part. \u201cThat forced me to start thinking outside the box right from the start,\u201d he notes. At one point the Rev. briefly walked away from guitar, when the tendons in his hands were plagued with cysts that inhibited his ability to play. Shortly after a surgeon removed them, he met Breezy and the couple\u2019s whirlwind romance and shared love of music inspired him to pursue his potential. Breezy took up the washboard, and by 2006 the members of the Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band had sold their possessions and taken to the road. That same year their initial album Big Damn Nation was released and The Gospel Album followed in 2008. With 2009\u2019s The Whole Fam Damily \u2014 and hundreds of thousands of touring miles in the U.S. and abroad under their belts \u2014 the Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band was hitting stride, but the Rev. considers 2010\u2019s The Wages, which entered the Billboard blues chart at number two and featured the buoyant airplay and YouTube winner \u2014 with 728,000 views and counting \u2014 \u201cClap Your Hands,\u201d his breakthrough as a songwriter. \u201cThat album came at a point when I decided I really wanted to work on myself as a writer and as a guitarist, because it was the great stories in the songs of my country blues heroes and their playing that brought me here in the first place,\u201d he avows. \u201cIf I wanted to follow in their footsteps, I had to step up.\u201d <br> By the time the Rev. recorded Peyton On Patton in four hours with a single microphone, the band had received the \u201cBest Band of the Warped Tour\u201d award and performed at the famed Austin City Limits, Glastonbury, Bonnaroo, WOMAD, Telluride, All Good, King Biscuit, Juke Joint and Riot festivals, among many other prestigious gigs. Between the Ditches, which debuted at number one on the iTunes blues chart and landed on Billboard\u2019s pop albums chart in 2012, continued that momentum, bringing the Rev. Peyton\u2019s Big Damn Band to an even larger, demographic-leaping audience thanks to the powerhouse songs \u201cDevils Look Like Angels\u201d and \u201cSomething For Nothing,\u201d which were video and radio hits. And now So Delicious offers a feast of new music from the Rev. and his accomplices. \u201cWhen people hear So Delicious and see us play live, I think they understand that what we\u2019re singing about is real to us,\u201d the Rev. says. \u201cWe believe in the stories we\u2019re telling and in the way we play. And when we\u2019re on stage or off, there\u2019s nothing fake about us. We are what we do, and I\u2019m proud of that.\u201d <strong>w/ The Low Counts</strong> w/ The Low Counts <br> <a href=\"http://www.thelowcounts.com\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thelowcounts.com', 'www.thelowcounts.com']);\" target=\"_blank\">www.thelowcounts.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.thelowcounts.com\">www.thelowcounts.com</a> <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $10 ADV, $12 day of show.

Known as \u201cthe producer\u2019s producer,\u201d Carroll commands respect among his peers and a steadily-growing audience of fans. A classically trained pianist and percussionist, but never content to color inside the lines, he became the youngest ever to win the title of Best Scratch DJ for his home state of North Carolina \u2013 at 17. In the years since, he has never stopped evolving, undergoing a f<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">ull transformation into a veteran producer, DJ, and dynamic live performer.</span></p>\n<p>His self-produced 2007 debut album Melanaster was the result of meticulous bedroom alchemy, recalling a lost Radiohead LP submerged in ten feet of saltwater. The album\u2019s sonic signature can be found somewhere between the beautiful haze of early \u201990s shoegaze rock (My Bloody Valentine) and early 2000s IDM (Autechre, Squarepusher). Smeared, melancholy pop songs tethered to abstract electronic rhythms, or what NPR called \u201cgorgeously subdued glitch-pop.\u201d</p>\n<p>In 2011, Carroll truly came into his own as a producer and live performer. He developed a solo PA set to bring a more raw and improvisatory vision of his music to live audiences, combining vocals, turntables, hardware controllers, and analog Moog synth. His onstage performances are exercises in understated talent that mix live vocals with stunning and unorthodox turntablist skills over a bed of sophisticated electronica. In 2012, he toured with forward-thinking producers like Shigeto, Dabrye, and Emancipator, and appeared at groundbreaking music festivals across the country (Moogfest, Decibel, Coachella). The galvanic dance floor energy of larger audiences infused his drum-driven 2012 EP R&amp;S / Cedars, and its title track garnered a favorable feature from XLR8R. Steadily, national attention was building for Carroll\u2019s unique style of subtle and compelling dance music.</p>\n<p>In December 2013 he released Sings, a new full-length LP that combines the best of his recent instrumental work with his considerable skills as a songwriter. A densely propulsive electronic album rooted in forest imagery, Sings received universal critical acclaim, drawing praise from tastemakers like Pitchfork, Rolling Stone, Stereogum, Bandcamp and Impose Magazine. Sings was named NC\u2019s Best Album Of 2013 by YES! Weekly.</p>\n<p>\u201cMarley Carroll is connoisseur of groove, a tastemaker with a diverse palette and great attention to detail. Gifted in the dark arts of composition, production and turntablism, Marley Carroll is a veteran in the making.\u201d \u2013 Emancipator</p>\n<p>Marley Carroll is currently unsigned.

Music unites us in ways that no other medium can. Even when we don't understand one another's languages \u2014 we can be moved by a rhythm, soothed by a song. Brought together by a unified sense of purpose \u2014 the spirit of five souls working as one, in harmony, creating sounds they could never produce alone.<br> <br> The five souls in Elephant Revival are Sage Cook (banjo, guitar, mandolin, tenor banjo, bass and fiddle); Bridget Law (fiddle, octave fiddle); Bonnie Paine (washboard, djembe, musical saw, stompbox); Daniel Rodriguez (guitar, banjo, bass); and Dango Rose (double-bass, mandolin, banjo). All share vocals and write songs. Paine delivers additional beats via footstomps on plywood, her stockinged feet doing near jigs as her hands, encased in antique leather gloves, rub silver nickel against corrugated metal.<br> <br> This Nederland, Colo., quintet are, needless to say, quite a sight to experience \u2014 especially when they fall into the pocket of a groove containing elements of gypsy, rock, Celtic, alt-country and folk.<br> <br> The Indie Acoustic Project simply labels their sound \"progressive edge.\" At least, that's the category in which it placed the band when it gave their Ruff Shod/Nettwerk Records release, BREAK IN THE CLOUDS, a best CD of 2011 award. It's as good a label as any to convey what Rose has described as their mission: \"to close the gap of separation between us through the eternal revelry of song and dance.\"<br> <br> Elephant Revival also shares a commitment to responsible stewardship of the planet and its inhabitants, working with organizations such as the Conscious Alliance, Calling All Crows, Trees Water &amp; People, and other nonprofits supporting humanitarian causes. Their very name was chosen out of empathy for a pair of zoo pachyderms who, upon being separated after 16 years, died on the same day. The band related that heart-rending story during their April 2012 debut on fellow Coloradoan Nick Forster's internationally syndicated \"eTown\" radio show \u2014 like Elephant Revival, a blend of music and social consciousness.<br> <br> Sitting in the audience during their performance, one music blogger was moved to write, \"Elephant Revival serenaded the crowd with arabesque melodies, harmonies and rhythms that braided and coiled into a sublime aural tapestry. Their instrumental dynamics, verse, and even the harrowing story that inspired their appellation, invoked the majesty, mystery and sorrow of Mother Earth.\"<br> <br> Campout for the Cause festival organizers put it this way in an affectionate shoutout on their Facebook page. \"We love Elephant Revival so much,\" they wrote, \"not just for their incredible music and conscious lyrics, but for their commitment to living up to the standards they set forth and setting positive examples.\"<br> <br> It's a paradigm worth spreading, and that's what Elephant Revival members intend to continue doing as they carry their music around the world, speaking one song at a time.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Elephant Micah w/ Wes Tirey, Abraham Leonard","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/1LBa7xR-ofQPMqfaihiHCQ557mPxtCkEFqxeKm7msGs/mtime:1427987825/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/wes-tirey.jpg?itok=VGQVpCGv\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-04-30 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23875","path":"/show/elephant-micah-w-wes-tirey-abraham-leonard","date_group":"2015-04-30 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Elephant Micah is music by southern Indiana songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Joseph O\u2019Connell.

Some singers are devoted to the pursuit of perpetual motion, and Langhorne Slim releases his wild soul in ways that come out of the discipline of live performance. The 13 songs that compose Langhorne Slim &amp; The Law\u2019s new The Way We Move are road-tested, rollicking and very rock \u2018n\u2019 rolling tunes that the songwriter perfected with his loyal band, and come out of the kind of good times and bad experiences that songwriters of Langhorne\u2019s lofty stature can turn into life-affirming rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. You could also call what Langhorne Slim does folk music, but then there\u2019s his sly, charming and open-hearted feel for pop music\u2014those summertime melodies that nudge you into a grin even when the song is about something bad. For Langhorne Slim\u2014Pennsylvania-born self-taught guitarist who moves to Brooklyn at 18, begins feeling out his place in a burgeoning punk-folk scene, wends his way to the West Coast, and finds himself celebrated from Newport to Portland as one of today\u2019s most original singers and songwriters\u2014The Way We Move represents the sound of a band devoted to living in the moment. Riding the success of his 2009 full-length Be Set Free, Langhorne went through some changes over the last three years\u2014he lost his beloved grandfather, who is the subject of the new record\u2019s moving \u201cSong for Sid,\u201d and moved on from a relationship that had lasted five years. And there was the physical moving\u2014the literal side of the record\u2019s title. Pulling up stakes from his home of two years, Portland, Ore., Langhorne also has been touring non-stop with The Law. As he says, \u201cI\u2019m in a bit of a transitional period\u2014currently, the road will be home. That\u2019s just kind of my spirit, to be slightly restless.\u201d Perfecting their rangy sound out on the endless grey ribbon, Langhorne and The Law\u2014 bassist Jeff Ratner, drummer Malachi DeLorenzo and banjo player and keyboardist David Moore\u2014went down to rural Texas in the summer of 2011 to work on new material. With some 30 tunes to consider, the quartet soaked up the Lone Star sunshine and developed arrangements and approaches for Langhorne\u2019s latest batch of songs. Jeff Ratner had joined the group at the time of Be Set Free, and brought on multi-instrumentalist David Moore not long after. Moore and Ratner go way back, having moved to New York around the same time, and they\u2019ve played together in what Jeff estimates are 15 bands. Langhorne\u2019s association with Malachi is equally deep. As the group played together through tours with the Drive-By Truckers and the Avett Brothers, and made appearances at the Newport Folk Festival and Bonnaroo, their bond became ever stronger, their music more confident. This is what you hear on The Way We Move\u2014forward motion meeting deep cohesion, all in the service of Langhorne\u2019s amazing songs and compelling vocals. \u201cWe wanted Langhorne\u2019s songs to shine, and be as raw as the creatures that we are,\u201d Jeff says of the recording process. The band set up in the Catskill, N.Y. Old Soul Studio, a 100-year-old Greek Revival house retooled for recording. With studio owner Kenny Siegal co-producing, Langhorne &amp; The Law fearlessly ran through an astounding 26 songs in four days, with Langhorne putting finishing touches on new tunes as they recorded. Langhorne says it was an intimate affair in Old Soul, with Moore\u2019s \u201cbanjo room\u201d in a coatroom and the piano in the living room. It comes through on The Way We Move\u2014the live feel of the sessions, which found Langhorne singing along with the band on every track. \u201cSinging with the band that way, it\u2019s almost like I was performing on stage,\u201d he says. Cutting everything live to tape gave the band exactly what they\u2019d been looking for: a super-charged evocation of their raucous, friendly stage performances. Langhorne and Jeff value in music for its rawness, and it doesn\u2019t matter whether that rawness\u2014the insurgent spirit that unites the Clash and Charlie Poole\u2014comes from in punk, country, soul or folk. Langhorne is a fan of Porter Wagoner, Jimmie Rodgers, Waylon Jennings, and early rock \u2018n\u2019 roll in general. But there\u2019s nothing referential or detached about the music Langhorne &amp; The Law make. Langhorne writes songs that are yearning, sad, happy, defeated and optimistic, with hints of \u201850s rock \u2018n\u2019 roll balladry. \u201cWe all love Wu-Tang Clan as much as we love Bowie, or Brazilian psychedelic pop,\u201d Langhorne says. On The Way We Move, David\u2019s probing piano often provides focus for Langhorne\u2019s tales of love and loss. \u201cOn the Attack\u201d begins with a delicate, watercolor section that turns into an ingenious variation on a classic soul ballad\u2014Solomon Burke meets punk blues in a smoky folk club. Langhorne addresses it to a current or past love. Similarly, \u201cPast Lives\u201d sports a piano introduction that gives way to a melancholy 6/8 ballad that perfectly supports lyrics about possible past lives and their interaction with the present. It\u2019s a spirited, inspired slice of real rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2014exuberance meets hard-won experience in an explosive combination. David\u2019s banjo and Malachi\u2019s walloping drums add up to a new kind of folk music. The music drives, but there\u2019s no loss of subtlety. And when the group lays into the garage-rocking \u201cFire,\u201d with its funky electric piano and supremely callow lyrics about first kisses and the hot-burning passions of adolescence, it\u2019s clear Langhorne is one of the great rock \u2018n\u2019 rollers of our or any time. Road-tested as the band is, the new music also shows just how far Langhorne Slim has come as a singer. He croons, exults and sings the blues throughout The Way We Move. And there are his lyrics, which are about strange dreams featuring women who want him dead even as he desires them, the pressures of small-town life, ambition, and how much he appreciates his mother\u2019s love and support. That\u2019s all Langhorne and his life\u2014his mother, he says, really was amazingly supportive of his ambitions to become a musician, as was the rest of his family. It comes through as you listen to his virtuoso demonstration of a singing style that seems alive to every fleeting emotional shade of meaning. Langhorne puts you in mind of John Lennon\u2019s singing from time to time\u2014it\u2019s nothing exact, and Slim doesn\u2019t do much music that is very Lennon- or Beatle-esque, but it\u2019s something in the timbre, and the openness of his vocals. It\u2019s worth repeating here that Langhorne learned Nirvana songs as he began to explore the guitar and songwriting, and Kurt Cobain\u2019s intense singing is another reference point. But these guys don\u2019t play the reference game, and like to keep it raw. The new record moves in ways that are fresh for Langhorne Slim &amp; The Law, and demonstrates all the ways we can go forward while keeping an eye on the mirror. They\u2019re laying down the law. It\u2019s very American, and when Langhorne Slim contemplates whether or not he fits in to any narrow-cast definition of this country\u2019s music, he replies with a perfect, laconic joke: \u201cI think we fit in most places that would take us.\u201d <strong>w/ The Dewars</strong> w/ The Dewars <br> <a href=\"https://dewars.bandcamp.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://dewars.bandcamp.com/', 'https://dewars.bandcamp.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">https://dewars.bandcamp.com/</a> <a href=\"https://dewars.bandcamp.com/\">https://dewars.bandcamp.com/</a> <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $15 ADV, $18 day of show.

Specializing in good time music that is just about impossible not to move to, there is also a depth to the band that faithful fans have treasured over the years. According to the legendary Doc Watson, \u201cLazybirds play a good variety of blues, jazz, and that good old ragtime sound, and you will hear the flavor of that in anything they play.\u201d The \u2018Birds cover a lot of musical ground, from early American stringband music to Dylan classics, as well as classic sounding originals, but deep roots are what hold all of these sounds together. The Lazybirds most recent CD release, \u201cBroken Wing,\u201d pays homage to founding member Andy Christopher, who played tenor banjo and tenor guitar, and sang with the band until being stricken suddenly with a mysterious heart condition. The title track, a Lazybirds original, describes how the band misses their soul brother; \u201cIt seems wrong you\u2019re not here on my right,\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a hole where there should be your banjo.\u201d Andy was with the band for part of the recording before he took sick, and you can hear his distinctive banjo picking particularly on \u201cLife,\u201d a Lazybirds rendition of the Sly and the Family Stone classic that will surprise most listeners other than long time fans, who expect the occasional knuckle-ball from this band. In essence the CD is life-affirming, moving through the blues, swing and deep country with humor and heart. \u201cBroken Wing\u201d has received sparkling reviews across the American southeast and in Europe.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Jahman Brahman w/ Electric Soul Pandemic, Mister F","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/VqDKmaYZXVvxUAFAz29NA_kFSw3tgt4iARFCR127o54/mtime:1428511888/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/13-atlg_461.jpg?itok=nQolzMsO\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-01 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/828715","nid":"24121","path":"/show/jahman-brahman-w-electric-soul-pandemic-mister-f","date_group":"2015-05-01 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Jahman Brahman</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.jahmanbrahman.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JahmanBrahman\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/27/01/13-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Jahman Brahman\" title=\"Jahman Brahman\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Jahman Brahman is a five-member collaboration originating from Columbus, Ohio in 2003, and currently residing in the mountains of Asheville, NC. The musical intuition of each member overcomes the restrictions of any particular genre as they pioneer the musical trail with a sound completely their own. The name Jahman Brahman emerged from each member's goal to achieve the ultimate state of musical c<br> ohesion; each instrument connected to one another to create a piece of music from the heart of one.<br> <br> They've described their particular style as shred 'n' flow, a dynamic sound with a wide breath of influence, but a focus on rich, fluid, progressions of energy. Providing the low end, Nate \"Brother\" Brown brings his own style of funked out and super fresh bass grooves giving depth to Justin Brown's full and conscious lyrics. Drummer Rowdy Keelor gives the sound its steady concrete pulse providing the heartbeat for Casey Chanatry's riveting guitar-work. Layered on top are Josh Loffer's transcendent key strokes and myriad of effects. Combined, Jahman Brahman leaves the listener with a message on life, love, and the wonders experienced being part of an extraordinary musical family.<br> <br> Each member holds a unique passion toward many different audio paths, with influences ranging from classic rock to electronica; from punk to jazz. Instead of conforming, they ascend music through the coalescence of their diverse styles, taking risks that unfold into powerful jams and creative compositions.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Electric Soul Pandemic</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.electricsoulpandemic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/48/86/65-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Electric Soul Pandemic\" title=\"Electric Soul Pandemic\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Electric Soul Pandemic (ESP) delivers high energy, high spirited music with a good time vibe in partership with stimulating lights, sights and sounds keeping you and the party dancing all night long.

But interpreting the music of The Band is an art. Songs that have reverberated across history for decades continue to speak to millions of us. And The Weight, a five-piece ensemble featuring Jim Weider and Randy Ciarlante from The Band, Brian Mitchell and Byron Isaacs of the Levon Helm Band and Marty Grebb, who worked with Rick Danko and Richard Manuel of The Band, remains a vehicle through which we can continue to share those stories and dance to those back beats. Come and take a load off. Jim Weider : (VOCALS / GUITAR) Jim replaced Robbie Robertson as lead guitar in the 2nd incarnation of THE BAND, from 1985 until 2000. In addition to being a songwriter, he also performed on their 3 studio albums: Jericho, High On The Hog and Jubilation. Along with Garth, Levon and Rick, he toured within the USA &amp; internationally as well as appearing with them in numerous films, videos and on TV. In addition to re-joining Levon in THE LEVON HELM BAND, Jim currently plays with Levon\u2019s MIDNIGHT RAMBLE BAND and his own ProJECT Percolator, THE WEIGHT &amp; THE BIG STRING ORCHESTRA. Randy Ciarlante: (VOCALS / DRUMS) Randy drummed &amp; sang alongside Levon in the second incarnation of THE BAND &amp; up until Levon\u2019s passing, he double-drummed in THE LEVON HELM BAND. He played drums with Levon and sang on The Band\u2019s albums, circa1990s, including Jericho, Jubilation and High On The Hog. Randy also leads his own amazing band, CKS. Brian Mitchell: (VOCALS / PIANO / B3 / ACCORDION / HARMONICA) Brian played in THE LEVON HELM BAND and continues to take his place at the piano, B3 &amp; accordion in Levon\u2019s MIDNIGHT RAMBLE BAND. He is well-known &amp; respected within the circles of the music industry &amp; beyond for his solo career &amp; for his high-profile collaborations. He\u2019s recorded &amp; performed with artists such as Levon Helm, Bob Dylan, Al Green, BB King and countless others. Byron Isaacs : (VOCALS / BASS) Byron currently plays with Levon\u2019s MIDNIGHT RAMBLE BAND, DIRT FARMER BAND, and also with his own band, OLLABELLE. Byron is a well-respected singer/songwriter and has written songs that appear on Levon\u2019s Grammy-winning CDs, Dirt Farmer and Electric Dirt. The lead vocals, harmonies and steady bass lines for which Isaacs has become known for also shape the gospel-infused feel that drives Ollabelle. Isaacs has played some of the world\u2019s most famous concert halls with some of contemporary music\u2019s biggest names including a gig at Carnegie Hall with Bruce Springsteen. Isaacs has also performed with Joan Baez, Willie Nelson, Ryan Adams, Elvis Costello, Diana Krall, Emmylou Harris, Sheryl Crow and Donald Fagen, \u2013 to name just a few. Marty Grebb: (VOCALS / B3 / PIANO / ACCORDION / SAXOPHONE) Marty is a former member of the Fabulous Rhinestones, Chicago, The Buckinghams and has played with The Rick Danko Band, Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Bonnie Raitt, Etta James, Greg Allman and Bonnie Bramlett.

Singer and bassist Tyler Reddick studied music at Chattanoooga State and brings a creative funk outlook to the band. Clark Jackson is a graduate from The Atlanta Institute of Music, being a college athlete before a musician, he brings the intensity from the field to the stage. The band started as a four piece with a supporting cast of musicians such as Ben Cooper, Yattie Westfield, and Tyler Wright. After three years of finding their sound they finally found THE group in long time friends William English and Kyle Kinzalow, who were members of the previous endeavor Dose Mojo. William and Kyle decided after a jam session that they wanted to make Soul Mechanic their full-time job. William English had been playing guitar for over 16 years at the time and was a self-taught phenom. Kyle Kinzalow performed in several bands before Dose Mojo, but finally found the style that he was looking for with William, Tyler, and Clark. When Florida State graduate Jessica Nunn moved from Tallahassee to Chattanooga, things really started to heat up for Soul Mechanic. She teamed up with the squad and her experience added a whole new level to the already driven Soul Mechanic. The newest edition is Jeff McSpadden, a former student and teacher at several independent percussion ensembles. This beast of a percussionist carried over a great vibe from the after-party specialist\u2019s Afro and has contributed greatly since his debut. </p>\n<p>Recently, Soul Mechanic has elevated their ranks with big performances at Chattanooga\u2019s very own \u201cRiverfront Nights\u201d and the fast growing Fly Free Festival. On the come-up, they\u2019ve played several sold-out after-parties for groups such as Widespread Panic, M.O.E., and Sublime with Rome. This band is hungry and has the potential to be on a major national tour in the near future.</p>\n<p>Website: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SoulMechanicMusic\">https://www.facebook.com/SoulMechanicMusic</a></p>\n<p>Check out a video: </p>\n<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JPs4iakApjM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>THE SHACK BAND</strong></p>\n<p>What originally started as an organic, impromptu and free-flowing collection of musicians casually performing in the renovated remains of a dilapidated \u201cshack\u201d in Blacksburg, VA has morphed into what is now The Shack Band. Since 2010, things have changed. The band relocated from Blacksburg to Richmond, VA. A true lineup was established, with four members signing on. The songwriting abilities and sensibilities matured and improved. At the start of 2013, the quartet became a quintet with the addition of a horn player adding more complex arrangements and texture to the band\u2019s already well-established sound. But, the one thing that never wavered was The Shack Band\u2019s intent to wow new crowds with their off-the-cuff, high-energy live shows melding funky rock \u2018n\u2019 roll and soaring harmonies with a strong emphasis on song-writing.</p>\n<p>In 2012 &amp; 2013, The Shack Band played 250 + shows up and down the East Coast and as far west as Chicago, while performing alongside a number of national touring acts, including: moe., Moon Taxi, The Machine, Perpetual Groove, The Pimps of Joytime, The Heavy Pets, Assembly of Dust, Everyone Orchestra and Dangermuffin among others. Thanks to their raw, infectious live shows and incessant touring, The Shack Band have seen, felt, and heard the effects of their budding reputation and burgeoning fan base. In February of 2012, they released their first EP, Born &amp; Raised, to a sold-out crowd in their hometown of Richmond, VA.

Joined by \u201cThe Mexican Ozzy\u201d Alex Marrero on vocals, the band is currently touring the world in support of their debut full-length album, Brownout Presents Brown Sabbath. The collection was released by Ubiquity Records in 2014 and would become among the most praised releases of 2014, including accolades from the likes of NPR, Pitchfork and USA Today. Even legendary Black Sabbath frontman Ozzy Osbourne weighed in, stating, \u201cI was shown a video of them performing \u2018The Wizard\u2019 and it was a lot of fun hearing it with a horn section. It was great!\u201d<br> <br> \"The Brown Sabbath idea started out like everything else we do, half inside joke, half psychotic. It was an overly ambitious attempt at challenging ourselves as musicians,\" says Brownout guitarist Adrian Quesada. \"Bridging the gap between our music and Black Sabbath is not as far of a stretch as it might seem though. Sabbath was not only heavy, but soulful and funky in their own dark way. Half the band grew up as metal heads too, so it came naturally. The experience is already beginning to influence our next album of original music.\"<br> <br> Throughout it\u2019s seven tracks, Brownout Presents Brown Sabbath remains true to the darkness, bombast and fuzz of Sabbath\u2019s sound, while re-imagining the music with greasy Afro-Latin horns, hypnotic percussion and psyched-out, rare-groove improv. The highly regarded metal website Invisible Oranges declared: \"Plenty of musicians have had the audacity to cover the original masters; few have done so as vividly, inventively, and satisfyingly as Brownout,\u201d while tastemaker blog Aquarium Drunkard wrote, \"Not only are these inventive and creative reworkings, they're infinitely funky and danceable. Latin percussion, fuzzy guitars, and funk beats collide on Sabbath\u2019s compositions and create a new kind of \u2018heavy.'\"<br> <br> Formed ten years ago by members of Grammy Award-winning Latin revival orchestra Grupo Fantasma, Brownout has evolved into a musical force all its own. After garnering their third Austin Music Award last year, the band has continued to produce music that is unflinchingly progressive, while evoking the classic influences of artists such as WAR, Cymande and Funkadelic. They've performed at events including Bonnaroo, High Sierra Music Festival, Pickathon, FFFFest, Bear Creek Music Festival, Utopia Festival and Pachanga Fest, while regularly touring the United States. Brownout has also served as a highly in-demand backing band for artists including Prince, Daniel Johnston, GZA and Bernie Worrell.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Raising Caine A Power House Alt Country Band","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-05-02 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24271","path":"/show/raising-caine-power-house-alt-country-band","date_group":"2015-05-02 00:00:00","venue":"7317","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.zackjoseph.com\">http://www.zackjoseph.com</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Closed for Private Event","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/Un5uHVc4kaEM1ZB0G0XZXylh8b4enp8fMA1ytIjIef4/mtime:1427987826/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/closed_bg_1320.gif?itok=CfY2ASCC\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-02 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23097","path":"/show/closed-private-event-15","date_group":"2015-05-02 00:00:00","venue":"7319","body":"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.highlandbrewing.com/ee-images/event-images/closed_bg.gif\" style=\"width: 396px; height: 268px;\"></p>\n"},{"node_title":"The Donkeys","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/-TlbalySa-oFU2halzo1r8_xEN0ufPLKCJkiRFJsF8o/mtime:1427987826/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Donkeys-featured-image_2.jpg?itok=WSyfFEno\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-03 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=3168877","nid":"22705","path":"/show/donkeys","date_group":"2015-05-03 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.donkeysongs.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.donkeysongs.com/', 'http://www.donkeysongs.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.donkeysongs.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.donkeysongs.com/\">http://www.donkeysongs.com/</a> <br> <code></code> <br> </p>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/COB7LAvzQxc?feature=oembed&amp;start=93\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <br> <code></code> <br> California places a distinct sonic stamp upon the music born with in its boundaries. Owens had his Bakersfield, Parsons his Joshua Tree, and Malkmus his Stockton, and in their tunes you can hear dust, desert highways, and skateboards gliding over suburbia. The Donkeys have San Diego, and from that environment have woven a fundamental ease in their music \u2013 a rock, a roll, a sway, a slide \u2013 you could even call it a breeze. On Ride the Black Wave, The Donkeys continue their easy rolling, classic vibrations, but add a mystery and tension that make this record their most lyrically and instrumentally compelling. Ride the Black Wave embodies what Jack Kerouac described of California\u2019s coast as having an \u201cend of the land sadness.\u201d The Donkeys stare out at the ocean in a \u201cfantastic drowse\u201d \u2013 a kind of pensiveness towards their environs that summons the elements of sound and style that belong only to them. In \u201cBlues In The Afternoon\u201d, a collective mantra, the band runs out of land and asks of the ocean to offer suggestions about their fate. It is songs like these that prove the Donkeys are a band in the true sense of the word, sharing each other\u2019s worry and wonder. With RTBW, The Donkeys have further caged their craft and have accomplished the delicate and artful challenge of taming the captured, while also letting it be wild. Recorded at San Diego\u2019s Singing Serpent and mixed by LA\u2019s Thom Monahan, the Telecasters have a golden shimmer, the drums seem to echo with a regional reverberation. The notes coming off the Rhodes float on like beer-buzzed afternoons, but just when you get lost in the hypnotic swirl of \u201cSunny Daze\u201d the churning guitars begin to circle like sharks, reminding us of the realities beneath all beautiful surfaces. Ten tracks deep, Adrianne Verhoeven of San Francisco\u2019s Extra Classic appears like the mythic Calafia herself, delivering a vocal that would bring Cortez to his knees. So, it is with Ride the Black Wave that The Donkeys add their own stratum to California\u2019s ever expanding musical frontier, while maintaining their golden \u201cshine\u201d as well as interjecting a tension with the sun and beauty. The record hypnotizes as much as it awakens; it poetically puts us at ease while we sit in traffic, peck at our keyboards in cubicles, or conversely, it accompanies us as we ride along desert highways, or sway with our lovers. It is about home; it is about waves, and surrendering to their movements, trusting that they will take us to where we truly belong. <strong>w/ Wayne Robbins &amp; The Hellsayers</strong> w/ Wayne Robbins &amp; The Hellsayers <br> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wayne-Robbins-the-Hellsayers/143527199039996\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/pages/Wayne-Robbins-the-Hellsayers/143527199039996', 'Hellsayers on Facebook']);\" target=\"_blank\">Hellsayers on Facebook</a> Hellsayers on Facebook <strong>&amp; The Knew</strong> &amp; The Knew <br> <a href=\"www.theknew.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.theknew.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.theknew.com\">www.theknew.com</a> <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $10 ADV, $12 day of show.

Owing much of their popularity and exposure to the social networking monster MySpace, the group \u2014 whose members usually wear masks on-stage \u2014 started as the musical project of J-Dog and Tha Producer in June 2005. They uploaded some new music to their profile and very quickly started amassing song plays and online friends with tracks about drinking, sex, and emo kids. \u201cThe gang\u201d, as the guys liked to refer to themselves, also grew to include six members: J-Dog and Tha Producer alongside Charlie Scene, Johnny 3 Tears (formerly called the Server), Funny Man, and Da Kurlzz. As the band\u2019s online profile steadily increased, MySpace head honcho Tom Anderson wasn\u2019t immune and wound up featuring Hollywood Undead\u2019s song \u201cNo. 5\u2033 on MySpace\u2019s first compilation album, in addition to giving them the distinction of being the first act signed to the site\u2019s new record label (distributed by Interscope) in 2005. Swan Songs finally appeared in 2008 on A&amp;M/Octone Records. A year later, that label released an album of B-sides, live tracks, and covers titled Desperate Measures. In 2010, vocalist Aron Deuce Erlichman left the group, he was replaced by Daniel \u201cDanny\u201d Murillo, a former contestant on American Idol and lead singer of Lorene Drive. After shows with Avenged Sevenfold on the Nightmare After Christmas Tour, Hollywood Undead released their sophomore album, American Tragedy, in April of 2011, and the album debuted in the top five of Billboard\u0092s Top 200. The following November, A&amp;M/Octone Records released a remix version of the record called American Tragedy Redux, which featured mixes by Andrew W.K., Borgore, and KMFDM, among others. In January of 2013, after embarking on The Underground Tour, the group released their third studio album, Notes from the Underground.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hollywoodundead.com\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://hollywoodundead.com', 'hollywoodundead.com');\" target=\"_blank\">hollywoodundead.com</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Jon Mueller (solo performance) w/ MANAS, 75 Dollar Bill","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/HkrpTYz_Np5Vxqek8oisx_SrbgXog7rxFwabLSL1vCM/mtime:1427987826/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/JonMueller_2014_02_2.jpg?itok=_b4L_-Tc\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-03 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/802625?utm_medium=bks","nid":"23535","path":"/show/jon-mueller-solo-performance-w-manas-75-dollar-bill-0","date_group":"2015-05-03 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Within a 40 minute solo performance of percussion and voice, using a hand-made Arabic bass drum and looped wordless vocals, Mueller conjures world music and sound while remaining very particularly other worldly.

Once I started to sing, all of those elements came into alignment I knew what I wanted to do.\u201d In 2003, he formed the Ryan Montbleau Band, which spent 10 solid years on the road until disbanding in 2013 after countless successful national tours, three studio records, and a double-live album recorded in partnership with Boston-based Life is good. \u201cCurrently I am a band of one,\u201d Montbleau said in 2014. \u201cI had an amazing group of guys on the road for a decade. We drove about 60,000 miles a year and played 200 shows a year. But last year we closed that chapter of our musical lives. We\u2019ll see what the future brings. In the meantime I\u2019m continuing to play solo, as I have always loved to do. And I\u2019m excited to be putting together new band configurations. It\u2019s all taking me back to the center of who I am as a performer and as a songwriter and who I want to be as an artist.\u201d In 2014, Montbleau\u2019s band configurations have been as inspired as his art. For his Gathering of the Vibes performance in July\u2014his tenth appearance at the Festival\u2014the band of \u2018Friends\u2019 he assembled included Marco Benevento, Mike Dillon, Stanley Jordan, Marc Friedman, John Kimock and Kenwood Denard. He\u2019s no stranger to playing with such world-class players. Montbleau\u2019s last record, For Higher, featured George Porter, Jr. on bass, Anders Osborne on guitar, Ivan Neville on keys and Simon Lott on drums, and was recorded over the course of two days in New Orleans with Galactic\u2019s Ben Ellman producing. The album is a bit different than Montbleau\u2019s band records in that he added some inspired cover tunes to the mix. But at the end of the day, Montbleau is a writer through and through. \u201cSongwriting sits at the center of my life, basically. I always look at life through the lens of songwriting and poetry. I tend to get little scraps of writing done constantly throughout each day and night of my life. The real challenge is to build and create finished pieces and to uncover the truth of a particular song. The words have to be just right and I don\u2019t stop until I get it right.\u201d At the end of the day, it works. An example is one of his best-known songs, \u201975 and Sunny,\u2019 a deceptively upbeat tune heavy on introspection and wordplay, as are most of Montbleau\u2019s songs. He was also invited to contribute songwriting (\u2018Something Beautiful,\u2019 \u2018One Night Only\u2019) to Backatown, Trombone Shorty\u2019s Grammy-nominated debut album. That went so well, Montbleau co-wrote two more songs (\u2018Do To Me,\u2019 \u2018Roses\u2019) for Shorty\u2019s 2011 follow-up, For True. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a huge transition over the last year and I feel like I\u2019m coming out on the other side beaming brighter than ever. I\u2019m excited by the new people I\u2019ve gotten to play with as well as just being able to see the effect that these songs can still have on a crowd. Whether it\u2019s solo acoustic, with a trio, or with a full band of amazing players, my goal is to put on a great show every single night and to sing my truth as clearly as I can. I think I\u2019ve been doing that and it\u2019s what I love to do.\u201d <strong>w/ Emily Kopp</strong> w/ Emily Kopp <br> <a href=\"http://emilykoppmusic.com/%20\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://emilykoppmusic.com/ ', 'http://emilykoppmusic.com/ ']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://emilykoppmusic.com/ </a> <a href=\"http://emilykoppmusic.com/\">http://emilykoppmusic.com/</a> <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $12 ADV, $15 day of show.

Growing up in small-town upstate New York, frontman Sam Harris, his brother Casey, and childhood friend Noah Feldshuh bonded over an obsessive love for punk, rock &amp; roll, soul, and hip-hop that defied the conventions of their peer group. Forming their first band in middle school, the three channeled their infatuation with artists as eclectic as The Stooges and The Staple Singers into a string of musical projects that sharply clashed with their local scene's favoring of folk and country. After graduating high school and decamping to New York City in search of a greater music community, the Harris brothers and Noah joined up with L.A.-raised drummer Adam Levin\u2014a move that helped X Ambassadors solidify their sound into a groove-fueled take on alt-pop, and ultimately land a deal with KIDinaKORNER/Interscope Records. Produced in collaboration with KIDinaKORNER founder Alex Da Kid, Imagine Dragons frontman Dan Reynolds and friend Dan Stringer, X Ambassadors' new EP Love Songs Drug Songs finds the Brooklyn-based foursome building off their singular chemistry to create a collection of songs both stylish and soulful. \"They're bringing together alternative and R&amp;B in a way I've never heard before, and at the core of that are these great songs with so much authenticity,\" says Alex, a Grammy-winning producer hailed for his work with heavyweights like Dr. Dre and Nicki Minaj. \"The music comes from a very real place,\" he continues, \"and it's made even more powerful by the deep connection that they have as a band.\" Throughout Love Songs Drug Songs, X Ambassadors weave elegant melodies and sweetly smooth vocals into taut arrangements powered by percussion. From the Afro-pop-inspired beats of \"Unconsolable\" to the fuzzed-out stomp of the title track to the slinky groove of \"Stranger,\" the heady rhythms at the heart of the EP endlessly mesmerize but never overshadow X Ambassadors' graceful musicianship. Still, even on the EP's breezier tracks\u2014such as the shimmering, harmony-kissed \"Down With Me\"\u2014X Ambassadors flaunt their finely honed pop sensibilities while radiating a raw intensity and darkly moody emotionalism. For X Ambassadors, the passionately charged pop heard all over Love Songs Drug Songs is the product of a lifetime of sonic exploration. Born into a highly musical family (Mom was a jazz and cabaret singer, Dad once aspired to be a country songwriter), Sam and Casey each began playing instruments before the age of ten. While Casey discovered his love for piano at seven, Sam (who \"started singing as soon as I could speak\") moved from drums to guitar to piano to bass to saxophone throughout his childhood. In junior high, Sam prompted Noah (his best friend since the first day of kindergarten) to learn guitar so that the two could start a group. \"Casey eventually started playing with us too, and ever since then I've only been in bands with the two of them,\" Sam notes. In 2006, the three moved from Ithaca to New York City so that Sam and Noah could attend the New School while Casey worked as a piano tuner. Within the first month of college Sam and Noah met Adam in the freshman dorms, learned he was a drummer, and slipped a demo under his door in a successful attempt to lure him into the band. With the lineup complete (Sam on vocals and guitar, Noah on lead guitar, Casey on keyboards, Adam on drums), X Ambassadors began playing local gigs and writing material for their debut album. Then, just before the band was scheduled to begin recording, a lifelong medical condition left Casey in urgent need of a kidney transplant. With both his brother and mother (who volunteered one of her kidneys) recuperating from the transplant, Sam began working on a new batch of songs, including a fierce yet tender ballad that would emerge as the title track on X Ambassadors' debut. Released in early 2012, Litost soon caught the ear of the program director for Norfolk, Virginia-based radio station 96x. After hearing \"Litost\" on a friend's Spotify playlist, the PD threw the song into heavy rotation and quickly drew a rabid response from listeners. Beating out heavy-hitters like fun. and Of Monsters and Men, \"Litost\" ended up emerging as 96x's number-one song of 2012. In the meantime, X Ambassadors began opening for the likes of the Lumineers and Imagine Dragons, as well as scoring slots on the lineups of such festivals as Lollapalooza. To expand their sound on Love Songs Drug Songs, X Ambassadors deepened the collaborative dynamic that's long been essential to their strength as a band. \"To me one of the most magical things about making music is taking a song idea to a group of people and letting them tear it apart and build something entirely new,\" says Sam, who serves as X Ambassadors' chief songwriter. \"I strongly believe that you discover so much more about the song in other people's hands than you ever would on your own.\" And during the recording of Love Songs Drug Songs, he adds, involving Reynolds and Alex Da Kid in that process yielded more than its share of sublime surprises. On \"Stranger,\" for example, Reynolds encouraged Sam to adopt \"this straight-up R&amp;B, Prince-y, Michael Jackson-y kind of vibe\" in his vocal work. \"Dan was like, 'You've got the voice, don't hold back, just go for it'\u2014which I wasn't expecting at all, but the way it worked out was so cool,\" Sam recalls. Not only fuel for their creative spirit, X Ambassadors' commitment to collaboration reflects an unfailing belief in the unifying power of music. Noting that the band's small-town beginnings infinitely inform their output, Sam points out that \"all those middle-school dances where they played Ginuwine and Ol' Dirty Bastard and all different kids would just come together and dance\" have proved to be one of his most formative musical experiences. \"It's always been my goal to make music that's unique and personal and completely true to who we are, but in a way that's got a very communal feeling to it, that can be shared with everyone,\" he says. \"If a song's melodies can feel perfectly formed but also natural, where you're feeling it so much that everyone else can't help but feel it too, then that's just beautiful.\"</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Dar Williams","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/rzn-vFd8Z7RltZIsBteIYcGmy15fFKGb8IyjK_Unlgs/mtime:1427987826/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Dar-Williams-featured-image-150x150.jpg?itok=WPBd99ac\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/JpEwWB0qnZGoLF1hKtQ1DSqmzFWvqDqTkw-VWqFPlls/mtime:1424384027/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Dar-Williams-featured-image_0.jpg?itok=i3e86XEB\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-06 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=6094411","nid":"21720","path":"/show/dar-williams-1","date_group":"2015-05-06 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.darwilliams.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.darwilliams.com/', 'http://www.darwilliams.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.darwilliams.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.darwilliams.com/\">http://www.darwilliams.com/</a> The initial idea came in a flash. Dar Williams was driving on an isolated highway, crossing from New York into Ontario, surrounded by frozen fields, silver trees, and empty sky, when inspiration struck. \u201cI thought, \u2018I want to write a biker song!,\u2019\u201d Williams says with a laugh. \u201cAnd then my second thought was, \u2018I want to write an epic biker song.\u2019 The Greek messenger of the dead is named Hermes, and I want to write about him-the god of travelers and thieves. \u201cI had this picture of Hermes starting to take a silver-haired woman down to her death, as she\u2019s asked him to do, and instead he seduces her, saying \u2018I love people like you who are experienced and worldly.\u2019 And then I thought, why don\u2019t I really freak out my record company and make a whole album about Greek mythology? So I decided to look at each of the gods of the Parthenon and see if their stories sprang to life for me or not.\u201d And from that moment came \u201cYou Will Ride With Me Tonight,\u201d the fifth song on In the Time of Gods, the ninth studio album by the beloved singer-songwriter. Produced by Kevin Killen (who has worked with such giants as U2, Elvis Costello, and Peter Gabriel), and featuring a remarkable set of musicians including Larry Campbell, Charley Drayton, Gerry Leonard, and Rob Hyman, the ten songs that resulted from exploring this theme became some of the richest music and most evocative writing of Williams\u2019s career. The complex and mysterious world of mythology aligned with several other issues that Williams was grappling with. \u201cI\u2019m interested in power right now,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m in my 40s, and I\u2019m shocked that the caf\u00e9 conversations I had in my 20s-\u2019Somebody has to do something!\u2019- are now my responsibility. I see people who are actually doing things that you always dreamed somebody would do, and I can help make that a reality. So the stakes are higher, in a good way, but you also see the shadow, the reckless behavior, where a person can lose it all in a weekend.\u201d Of course, the ceaseless turmoil in the world today is of great concern to this seasoned artist who\u2019s also a wife, mother and \u201cinvolved neighbor,\u201d as she puts it, active in her community. \u201cA lot of what\u2019s going on is actually really gross,\u201d she says, \u201cand to see it as epic, instead of doomed, is helpful for me. These stories and characters helped me make sense of it.\u201d Williams, though, wanted to be sure that she was serving the songs themselves, and was prepared to abandon the mythology theme any time it didn\u2019t naturally fit; \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be a gimmick or a test,\u201d she says. But she was pleased to find how flexible and expansive these archetypes really are. \u201cThe Light and the Sea\u201d began with the notion of the sea god Poseidon, but became a meditation on retaining a moral compass. \u201cAs I get older, my big struggle isn\u2019t being virtuous and moral, it\u2019s more about what I do in chaos,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWhen I\u2019m stressed out, I say and do terrible things. There\u2019s a light to follow, and you can lose it in chaos.\u201d Other songs brought ancient themes directly into the Hudson Valley home Williams shares with her husband, their son, and their young, Ethiopian-born daughter. She describes \u201cWrite This Number Down\u201d as \u201can Athena-ish song\u201d written for her younger child. \u201cIt\u2019s telling her not to lose faith, because even when the justice system isn\u2019t up to what you want it to be, there will be networks of people who will help you find justice.\u201d Williams also wanted to write a song for her husband. \u201cWhen I go on the road, there\u2019s an understanding that it is part of our relationship,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the Parthenon, there is one goddess-Vesta, goddess of the hearth-who sits in the middle of the hall stoking the fire. I never thought that I needed a hearth, but that\u2019s my home, and also my marriage, an anchor in my life that just gets better all the time. So \u2018I\u2019ve Been Around the World\u2019 does correlate, but I would have written that story no matter what.\u201d As documented on her last album, the 2010 two-disc retrospective Many Great Companions, Williams\u2019s growth as an individual over her almost two-decade-long career has gone hand-in-hand with her evolution as an artist. Raised in Chappaqua, N.Y., and educated at Wesleyan University, Williams spent 10 years living in the thriving artistic community of Northampton, Mass., where she began to make the rounds on the coffeehouse circuit. Joan Baez, an early fan of her music, took Williams out on the road and recorded several of her songs. In 1995, two years after self-releasing The Honesty Room, she signed with Razor &amp; Tie Entertainment, beginning a relationship now in its 16th year. Along with her studio albums, she\u2019s also released the onstage document Out There Live (2001) and the DVD Live at Bearsville Theater (2007). The final song on In the Time of Gods manages to bring all of her concerns-social, creative, and personal-under one roof. \u201cWe have a mountain close to our house called Storm King,\u201d says Williams. \u201cWhen a circle of clouds gathers around the top of it, that means the rain is coming. Pete Seeger lives across the river and can see the mountain, and I wrote a song saying that Pete is the storm king now. He looks down and watches over us, guides and warns us, like the mountain does. \u201cSo my \u2018Storm King\u2019 is not a king of Greek mythology,\u201d Williams continues. \u201cHe\u2019s a father figure who influences me from two miles up the road, where he composts and chops his own wood, and reminds me of my responsibilities. \u2018Storm King\u2019 is my way of saying that we aren\u2019t living in 400 BC Greece, we are evolving in time. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re allowed to do with mythology-to let it evolve and show who your Parthenon is now.\u201d That\u2019s the great achievement of Dar Williams\u2019s album. With ease and grace, it reminds us that wherever we are, whenever it may be, we are always living In the Time of the Gods. <strong>w/ Trevor Gordon Hall</strong> w/ Trevor Gordon Hall <br> <a href=\"http://www.trevorgordonhall.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.trevorgordonhall.com/', 'http://www.trevorgordonhall.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.trevorgordonhall.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.trevorgordonhall.com/\">http://www.trevorgordonhall.com/</a> <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $25 ADV, $28 day of show.

His experiences as a record collector and music obsessive from a very young age (\u201cI got into punk in the third grade\u201d) are easily evident in his debut release. Going full circle from being introduced to 60\u2032s pop as a kid, through his foray into punk rock at an early age, into post-rock and Elephant Six indie, right back into 60\u2032s Psychedelia, Ben has honed his influences (Neil Young, Television Personalities, \u2018Elevators, The \u2018Dead, Olivia Tremor Control) into a cohesive blend to adapt his own take on psych-influenced art-pop. The tracks on the record were written and demo\u2019ed around the time Ben was in college (and shortly after) in Athens, GA where he was studying psychology, religion and sociology\u2026 as well as developing a fascination with analog synth that made it\u2019s way into his mix of influences. Meanwhile, he started the RTA Collective, which featured his cassette and CDR releases along with his visual art. This combination arrived in a package to the Captured Tracks office in the form of a demo that stood out amongst the hundreds of others with it\u2019s charged DiY silkscreen imagery and poppy fuzz psych music. The label enlisted Jarvis Taveniere (Woods, Rear House Recording) to record and produce what would become Axxa/Abraxas debut.

Eight souls from Los Angeles who will move your ass and melt your face. <br> <br> Pronounced with a long second \"O,\" the Los Angeles band Orgone is dedicated to heavy, raw, adrenaline-fueled funk and sweat-dripping soul. With a core rhythm section of close friends and self-taught musicians steeped in local DJ culture, Orgone has spent the last decade expanding their roster and evolving a sound rooted in old school respect but pulsing with the force of the new millennium. Orgone has become a staple on the festival circuit while gaining a reputation among fellow artists as one of the baddest go-to backing bands on the planet. Always evolving musically and cosmically, Orgone continues to connect with kindred musical spirits throughout the universe with relentless touring and the upcoming release of their fifth full-length album. Starting out as an instrumental five piece by friends with a love of funk records, Orgone cut their teeth putting their own gritty takes on cuts by the Meters, Booker T. &amp; the MGs, Grant Green and Funkadelic among others. In 2002, the band independently released Orgone, a collection of tough, stripped-down, funk instrumentals that Relix Magazine called \"intoxicating\" and that quickly became a favorite of die-hard, funk fans. Orgone solidified that underground respect in 2006, adding a powerful horn section and releasing their second album, Bacano, a set of all-original, cold-blooded funk gems in the classic vein of War and Mandrill with improved, warm, organic production that matched the evolution of the band's sound. The release of their cover of \"Funky Nassau\" on both 7\" and 12\" became a an instant dance floor classic, inspiring a club-edit by renowned DJ Danny Krivit and paving the way for The Killion Floor in 2007, Orgone's first full-length album for the legendary Ubiquity Records.<br> <br> Orgone proved their continued evolution when the critically-acclaimed Cali Fever was released in 2010. The album was musical chameleon, shifting between West Coast cool, New Orleans grit, Lagos afrobeat, and heavy Mothership funk, taking, in the words of Dusty Groove America, \"a rough, rugged, and uber soulful live funk vibe into a deeper and even livelier realm!\" Released later the same year, an all-instrumental album The Killion Vaults showcased Orgone's</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Sophistifunk</span></div>\n<div class=\"bio\">SOPHISTAFUNK met in 2007 and rapidly evolved into a national-touring live act.

Loud and proud, they sing about what they know with a refreshing directness and clarity. Some call it rebel music, but it\u2019s more like everyday soul. Their songs are stories, with relatable characters and situations. Stories of celebration, of mourning, of trials and triumph. Through the quality of these songs, and the band\u2019s undeniable power in concert and on record, Whiskey Myers has attracted a devoted army of outspoken fans who pack venues, sing the band\u2019s praises online, and continue to make them a growing word-of-mouth sensation. On February 4, 2014 they unleashed the thrilling \u2018Early Morning Shakes\u2019 upon the world. Their latest full-length was recorded with noted producer Dave Cobb (whose credits include Jamey Johnson, Jason Isbell, and both Waylon and Shooter Jennings) and represents the culmination of years of dedication, experimentation, and refinement. Visceral and dynamic, the album\u2019s 12 songs encompass an impressive range of perspectives and emotions \u2013 while finding the band\u2019s musicianship honed to a razor\u2019s edge. And though Early Morning Shakes is a great step forward creatively, it\u2019s an organic one. As guitarist John Jeffers explains, \u201cStaying true to ourselves and to our music has gotten us to the point we\u2019re at. We really wanted to continue on that same track.\u201d The collaboration with Cobb became a vital partnership, essential to Early Morning Shakes\u2019 edgy yet accessible sound. \u201cI have to credit Dave for creating a natural, relaxed recording atmosphere,\u201d says drummer Jeff Hogg. \u201cIt allowed us to be comfortable, creative, and to better express ourselves. Plus, his experience mixing country and rock in his production works perfectly for us.\u201d One listen to the lacerating title track \u2013 \u201cThe coolest song we have ever done,\u201d beams lead singer and principal songwriter Cody Cannon \u2013 makes very clear that Cobb was an ideal choice to harness the band\u2019s growing power and confidence. Although always unabashed, the soul of Whiskey Myers comes through clearer than ever on Early Morning Shakes, from the disarming tenderness of \u201cShelter from the Rain\u201d to the winking rabble rousing on display in their version of outlaw forefather David Allen Coe\u2019s \u201cNeed a Little Time Off for Bad Behavior.\u201d It\u2019s that rare album that promises to enthrall the band\u2019s vocal, devoted fanbase while enticing new listeners. And it couldn\u2019t come at a better time\u2026 Whiskey Myers\u2019 last record, Firewater, was released in the spring of 2011, and enjoyed a remarkable run on the Texas Music Charts that culminated with its third single \u201cAnna Marie\u201d reaching #1. Airplay success has led to larger and larger crowds, with the band now selling out 1,000-capacity venues with ease \u2013 and delivering stadium-sized shows grounded in the sincerity and unpretentious, fun-loving energy of their bar-band roots. \u201cOur fans always tell us how much they get out of seeing us play,\u201d says Cannon, \u201cbut it\u2019s a two-way street: We get something, too. They inspire us to dedicate ourselves more and more to our music and our sound. And it sure feels like it\u2019s paying off.\u201d As their chemistry onstage and in the studio reflect, Whiskey Myers is a brotherhood. The five members cut their teeth together, honing their chops side-by-side from an early age. Hailing from Neches, Texas, Cannon was given an acoustic guitar by his \u201cwild-ass biker\u201d (Cody\u2019s words) grandpa, and guitarist John Jeffers\u2019s dad taught them both the rudiments of the instrument. A job at a sporting goods store introduced Cannon to future Whiskey Myers lead guitarist Cody Tate, forming the songwriting core of the band. Upon moving to Tyler, Texas, they picked up drummer Jeff Hogg and enlisted Cannon\u2019s cousin Gary Brown on bass\u2014even though he\u2019d never played the instrument before. What came next was a blur of gigs, songs, struggles, and victories: With each show, their natural bond as friends continued to grow into a formidable musical telepathy, and with each song they composed, their innate gifts as craftsmen were honed further. The resultant sound, taken to its apex on Early Morning Shakes, is hard-driving and immediate, steeped in the rich legacy of southern rock. Often reduced to a one-dimensional stereotype, the kind of music that inspired Whiskey Myers\u2014artists like Lynyrd Skynyrd, the Allman Brothers, and Hank Williams, Jr.\u2014is actually multifaceted and inventive, drawing from country, R&amp;B, psychedelic rock, and stringband traditions. In that tradition, Whiskey Myers are grand southern eclectics, pulling in an array of influences and seamlessly mingling them. Listeners can pick up traces of everything from grunge to rockabilly in the course of a set, united by Cannon\u2019s soulfully heartfelt singing and Brown and Hogg\u2019s solid, supple foundation. On top of it all, Tate and Jeffers intertwine their leads, soaring in harmony one moment, darting around one another in intricate improvisations the next. Sure, they\u2019re rousing\u2014just cue up \u201cHard Row to Hoe\u201d or \u201cWhere the Sun Don\u2019t Shine\u201d from Early Morning Shakes for a dose of pile-driver intensity. But their range is wide and expanding, as is evidenced by the inclusion of moving, thoughtful reflections like \u201cReckoning\u201d and the elegantly arranged \u201cColloquy.\u201d In Whiskey Myers\u2019 world, nothing is off-limits. Nothing is too personal, too sensitive, or too controversial to embrace and explore. Theirs is a confidence born of a long-standing brotherhood\u2014a closeness that few groups can rival. That closeness even extends to their road crew, whose first two members were a cousin and childhood friend of Cannon and Jeffers. \u201cWell we all grew up together,\u201d bassist Brown explains. \u201cWe\u2019re two sets of cousins. Some of us have been friends since we were two or three years old.\u201d Cannon picks up the thread immediately, adding \u201cPlus, after six years together, you know each other through and through. We know who we are, and try our best to stay true to ourselves and to our music.\u201d <strong>w/ Jamie Kent</strong> w/ Jamie Kent <br> <a href=\"http://www.jamiekent.com\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.jamiekent.com', 'www.jamiekent.com']);\" target=\"_blank\">www.jamiekent.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.jamiekent.com\">www.jamiekent.com</a> <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $10 ADV, $12 day of show.

Raised in the same small Piedmont town, they relocated to the mountains of Asheville to explore and develop their mutual love of song. The fruit of their partnership has often been shockingly eclectic, including a Norwegian Black Metal project, a disturbingly dark Children's Album, and several self-released records worth of deceptively charming, patently weird Folk Noir. <br> <br> The Toothe's most recent effort is The Talons EP, a six-song foray into a hook-laden and intensely engaging sound they call Psychedelic Folk. Recorded in their home studio and mixed by Danny Kadar (Band of Horses, The Avett Brothers, My Morning Jacket), The Talons EP draws from a deep well of American musical tradition while simultaneously reveling in a jubilant pop energy and outlandishly off-kilter lyrical musings. The songs of The Talons EP, which range from up-beat and lively pop delight to contemplative and intricately-crafted ballads, aim to take the listener on a psychedelic journey across mesmerizing musical and emotional landscapes. <br> <br> Known for their captivating, high-energy live performances, The Toothe have travelled up and down the Eastern Seaboard with their music, capturing the hearts and eardrums of everyone they encounter. What the future holds for this band is uncertain, but there is no doubt that they will continue to expand into uncharted musical territory, paving their own way.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Warm The Bell</span></div>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/96/41-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Warm The Bell\" title=\"Warm The Bell\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Warm the Bell was created in Asheville, NC by songwriters and local music scene veterans Sean Robbins (Nevada), Vickie Burick (Nevada) and Sam Brinkley (Rafe Hollister, Drunken Prayer).

Big Inner earned five stars in The Guardian and a spot on its year-end list, plus those of Pitchfork, eMusic and Consequence of Sound. But White hadn't rested or seen his family very much. At last, he was excited to do both. The insomnia, though, didn't stem from childlike anticipation of early-morning presents. Actually, White hurt too much to sleep. Not long after he arrived in Virginia Beach, he developed a sudden case of shingles, the stresses of the last year-and-a-half rendering themselves in painful physical form. So while his parents visited his grandmother and his sister celebrated with her own family just a few blocks away, White spent Christmas Eve alone in his childhood double bed. But that was OK, as the break gave him the chance to consider the bizarre turns his life had taken\u2014that is, how he went from making a solo record by accident to embracing a solo career so busy it had made him sick. \"For the first time, I remember thinking, 'What just happened?'\" he says, laughing long after the shingles have passed. \"I thought about all the places I went, the people I played to, the people who cared about my record and felt moved by it. That was the craziest year of my life by miles and miles\u2014and the hardest and the most exciting, too.\" To backtrack, briefly: In 2009, White and a cadre of friends developed the idea of Spacebomb Records, an old-fashioned label and production house meant to turn the tunes of songwriters they liked into grandiose, graceful statements. They had in-house strings and horns and a choir at their behest, too. Collectively, the musicians possessed a wide, working knowledge that could pivot from the gusto of New Orleans to the verve of Detroit, from tube-amp rock to hi-fi pop. Sure, people like to talk about White's past with jazz or his love of classic American songcraft. It's telling, however, that as a high school student, he interned at Master Sound, the hometown studio that Pharrell Williams eventually turned into the epicenter of his empire. To demonstrate the Spacebomb ideal, White and his wide cast recorded a few songs he'd pieced together, hoping mostly to show other songwriters how the system would work. But those cuts became Big Inner, the record that Uncut termed \"one of the great albums of modern Americana\" and caused Paste to proclaim that White was one of music's \"best new bands.\" Tours, interviews, photo shoots and, well, the shingles followed. While White spent Christmas Eve considering what had happened, he already knew what was going to happen next: When the holidays ended, he would begin turning the bits and bobs of song ideas he'd collected on tour into his second album, bolstered by the validation of welcome he'd found in the wider world. If the first album had been serendipity, every step of this one was to be deliberate, from his co-writing sessions with longtime friend and former bandmate Andy Jenkins to his steady arrangement brainstorms with the trusted Spacebomb house band\u2014bassist Cameron Ralston, drummer Pinson Chanselle and guitarist Trey Pollard, who co-produced the subsequent recording sessions with White. There were timelines and deadlines, detailed discussions about who would mix the music (New York staple Patrick Dillett) and the many stories the songs would share. The result is the audacious, confident and masterful Fresh Blood, a record that feels like the brilliant bloom to Big Inner's striking bud. Fresh Blood is a bracing, beguiling record and a bold advance for White. Opener \"Take Care My Baby\" is his step-into-the-light moment, a sophisticated but instantly winning soul number where love becomes a panacea for woe. That enthusiasm crosses over for \"Fruit Trees,\" a smiling, seductive number where White\u2014his voice traced and teased by horns, strings and harmonies\u2014begs for a paramour to \"let me sleep in your tent tonight.\" Sometimes these situations don't go well, though, which White confesses during \"Feeling Good is Good Enough.\" It's a breakup song in ecstatic pursuit of temporary carnal relief. And while it's got nothing to do with love, lust or leaving, the sassy \"Rock &amp; Roll is Cold\" radiates the aplomb of an artist who has stumbled into success and taken charge of the circumstances. White's having fun, trading lines with backup singers and saxophones alike, teasing components of the gospel, soul and rock form that shape the very backbone of the music he makes. This is White's party, and he's a most welcoming host. That same spirit presides during the set of more solemn and pointed songs that serve as Fresh Blood's core. For White, one lesson of Big Inner and the tours that followed was that he wanted to be able to believe in his songs every night, to know that the words he sang were more than vehicles for memorable melodies. \"I didn't like singing 'Steady Pace' every night. It was too light. It didn't age well for me,\" he says. \"My peers and I sometimes have a lack of concern and awareness for the world around us\u2014culturally, politically, socially. We are in danger of being lulled to sleep by our culture's excess. I'm not writing political songs yet, but I've tried to at least write songs that have to do with the variety and reality of our lives.\" And so, at the record's center, White delivers a trilogy of beautiful reflections on the world as he sees it. An agitated but elegant excoriation of sexual abuse in the church, \"Holy Moly\" rages like a missing midpoint between Neil Young's Harvest and Tonight's the Night. \"Tranquility\" meditates on the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman, a consummate artist whose dual force and frailty has long resonated with White. And in \"Circle 'Round The Sun,\" a look at the suicide of a dear friend's mother, White finds one of the most exquisite moments of balance in his entire career. It is a love song written from the perspective of the recently departed, calmly exploring a tumult of conflicting loyalties\u2014to Jesus, to family, to life, to death. \"Wading in the water, Lord, keep my son and daughter,\" White sings, at once gentle and resolved over steady and soft piano and drums. \"Put your arms around me, Jesus, tonight.\" At the risk of heresy, Fresh Blood feels as comfortable and fraught as those lines and that song. Simultaneously recognizing the trouble and delight that life can bring, these 10 numbers are guides for times of joy, agony and the middle distance where we most often linger. After only two albums, Matthew E. White feels now like an old friend who has seen what we've seen, heard our stories and done his best to make a record that gives them necessary gravity. That way, when we lay awake at night considering our own pain or worry, we've got new anthems to keep us company. Domino will release Fresh Blood worldwide on CD, LP and digitally March 15, 2015.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Todd Cecil and Back South Rockin Delta Mississippi Blues","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-05-08 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24273","path":"/show/todd-cecil-and-back-south-rockin-delta-mississippi-blues","date_group":"2015-05-08 00:00:00","venue":"7317","body":"<p><a href=\"http://laurisvidal.com\">http://laurisvidal.com</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Panda Bear","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/zrBZ6mutS5LM364p-Od2P_FiXpJucMMnk-PpdeazIFg/mtime:1427987827/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/pandabear_0.jpg?itok=Wv251mp2\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-09 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=7739148&partner_id=240","nid":"23656","path":"/show/panda-bear-0","date_group":"2015-05-09 00:00:00","venue":"7311","body":"<p>When <strong>Panda Bear</strong> met the Grim Reaper, they jammed. <strong>Noah Lennox</strong>, a.k.a. <strong>Panda Bear</strong>, a.k.a. one-fourth of the founding members of <strong>Animal Collective</strong>, has had a far-from-quiet few years since the release of his fourth solo record, 2011\u2019s <strong>Tomboy</strong>.

With a surging rhythm section, razor sharp violin, and flourishing banjo and guitars, Dekker and band mates have pushed their sound significantly, creating some of their most dynamic songs ever recorded. Those familiar with the decade-long output of Great Lake Swimmers will recognize the thematic threads of beauty in the natural world, environmental issues and explorations of close personal ties that hold us together. The familiar versus the strange theme is also running through this record, both in the instrumentation and in the songwriting (\u201cZero In The City\u201d, \u201cI Was A Wayward Pastel Bay\u201d). As with past Great Lake Swimmers albums, A Forest Of Arms was recorded in several locations over the span of several months, covering extensive new territory while remaining true to the group\u2019s refined sound. One of the unique and unusual locations was Tyendinaga Cavern and Caves in Tyendinaga, Ontario, where a number of the vocal and acoustic guitar tracks, including the main parts for \u201cDon\u2019t Leave Me Hanging,\u201d \u201cThe Great Bear\u201d and \u201cWith Every Departure,\u201d were recorded amid haunting acoustics, stalactites, and circling bats. The violins were recorded at the Heliconian Club of Toronto, while the bass and drum tracks were largely recorded at the Chalet Studio just outside of Toronto, a unique chalet-style recording space located on 40 acres of rolling hills and trails, in proximity to the shores of Lake Ontario. The pastoral and elemental nature of these spaces surfaces throughout the album. The title, A Forest Of Arms, is taken from album track \u201cThe Great Bear,\u201d a song inspired by a trip Dekker took to the northern rainforests of British Columbia in September 2013 with the World Wildlife Fund. It\u2019s a pristine wilderness area that is under threat of being compromised by the construction of a pipeline, and Dekker and the group have been very vocal in their opposition to it. In a broader sense, the title is also a reference to the sense of community surrounding the Toronto-based band, as well as the band\u2019s own growing families, exhibited in the songs \u201cSomething Like A Storm\u201d and \u201cExpecting You.\u201d Great Lake Swimmers consists of Tony Dekker on lead vocals and guitar, long time guitarist and banjo player Erik Arnesen, Miranda Mulholland on violin and backing vocals, Bret Higgins on upright bass and newcomer Joshua Van Tassel on drums. There are several special guest appearances on the album by Kevin Kane (Grapes Of Wrath) on 12-string electric guitar, as well as backing vocals on the song \u201cA Bird Flew Inside The House.\u201d Recorded and engineered by their long time live sound technician Justin Shane Nace, and mixed by the wonderfully talented Howie Beck (Feist), A Forest Of Arms also marks Dekker\u2019s 8th release of new material. In 2013, he released the solo album Prayer of the Woods, and in 2014, he released a tribute album for the artist-loving digital music distribution site Zunior on the occasion of its 10th year anniversary, entitled Tony Dekker Sings 10 Years Of Zunior. Last year saw their debut headlining performance at Toronto\u2019s historic Massey Hall, which was documented for the Live At Massey Hall series. The band also participated in the Polaris cover sessions with their version of Sarah Harmer\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m A Mountain.\u201d <strong>w/ Edward David Anderson</strong> w/ Edward David Anderson <br> <a href=\"http://www.edwarddavidanderson.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.edwarddavidanderson.com/', 'http://www.edwarddavidanderson.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.edwarddavidanderson.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.edwarddavidanderson.com/\">http://www.edwarddavidanderson.com/</a> <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $14 ADV, $17 day of show.

The Denver-based duo began writing music together as a way to document their time living at sea on a small forty year old sailboat. The result was their first release, Cape Dory which saw them quickly become one of the most alluring and blogged about bands of the new decade. Moore and Riley followed Cape Dory with Young and Old, which The New Yorker described as \u201cwinsome as it is ebullient,\u201d and debuted #1 on Billboard\u2019s Heatseeker Chart and #1 on CMJ Top 200, where it remained for three straight weeks. The album also debuted on Soundscan\u2019s \u201cNew Artist Chart\u201d at #1 remaining there for nine consecutive weeks. In 2013 the Small Sound EP debuted on Communion Music, followed by thousands of miles on the road, and a support tour with sister super-group, Haim. Late last year, the duo released Ritual In Repeat. Produced by Patrick Carney (The Black Keys), Jim Eno (Spoon) and Richard Swift (The Shins), their latest full length showcases a band in full control of their sound and craft.

Arguably metal's hardest working band, INCANTATION has ventured forth like conquering crusaders, converting thousands of new fans time after time. From Canada to Colombia, Argentina to Europe, Central America to Australia and the States, INCANTATION has endeavored to reach every corner of the world.

Vanquish in Vengeance, INCANTATION's long-awaited follow up to 2006's Primordial Decimation, features over 50 minutes of the band's trademark dark and unholy death metal.

After an extended weekend of knocking back brews (and maybe a little blow) he met drummer Sterling Trull one morning in 6th grade. Sterling, who also had the runs from a weekend of drinking decided they should skip gym, pick up a 12 pack and start practicing. After playing KC &amp; The Sunshine Band covers in sleazy strip joints for a few years they met Jesse \"The Mexicutioner\" Gonzalez. Jesse, who was high on bath salts and pissed because a gang of third graders had stolen his taco truck knew he had found his band. With fiery vengeance they immediately began writing songs which would later be featured on their 2012 debut EP \"Disgust\". With such lyrics and song titles as \"Childgrinder\" and \"Teenage Human Shield\" you'll wanna hand power tools to toddlers once you hear the sound sensations of We Kill Kids pulsing through your skull!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Amnesis</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-4\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.reverbnation.com/amnesis\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amnesisband\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-4\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-4', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/31/20/51-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Amnesis\" title=\"Amnesis\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Formed in the fall of 2011, Amnesis was rooted by the common interests of reunited guitarist Jason Miller and Frontman Jaysun Brenneman, with hopes of bringing something different to the local scene. After a few lineup changes and the constant evolution of the sound they desired Amnesis began playing shows in the spring of 2012, afterwhich they released an independent EP entitled \"Sick is the New Sane\". Following a brief period of writing and the addition of Hajji Grape on guitar and Chris Swayney on drums the band began playing shows heavily in support of the band's first single \"Ultraviolence\", a song that that captured the attention of the metal crowd an became an icon for the band. In the fall of 2013 the band picked up Ryan Welchel whos stage personality is best represented by his trademark mask and distinct military garb. This inspired Amnesis to take a different approach to their stage presence as the members all currently are represented at live shows by characters which they have manifested into, some wearing masks. Amnesis is currently a regional act and are playing shows in the Southeastern United States while finishing their first independently released full-length</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Asheville Ruckus Presents: Incantation / Funerus","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/90nKvmNqjqNzBEgoEJSxgcdwTcqNBcHyMmrDGdiezQo/mtime:1424384029/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/35-atlg_12.jpg?itok=2pdcvxy3\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-13 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"21644","path":"/show/asheville-ruckus-presents-incantation-funerus","date_group":"2015-05-13 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Incantation</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.incantation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/incantation5\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IncantationOfficial\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Incantation666\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/41/16/35-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Incantation\" title=\"Incantation\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Without a doubt one of the most important bands ever to emerge in the world of extreme music, INCANTATION has set the standard for USDM and is often credited as a pioneer in the genre.

They have offered twice as many (if not more) explanations for why they chose to name their band after a Rugrats character. But these days, the Athens, GA based group is sticking to this one: \"I first tried to name the band Invisible Boyfriend,\" giggles singer-guitarist Graham Ulicny. \"And everybody goes, 'that is the stupidest name I have ever heard in my life.\" So why Reptar? \"It is the second stupidest band name we have ever heard.\" Indeed, there is no pretense behind Reptar, which also includes Andrew McFarland (drums), Ryan Engelberger (Bass), and William Kennedy (analog keyboards). Still, the ability to amuse and arouse their fans is just as important to them as indulging their musical curiosities. This sonic wanderlust extends from African Music to post-punk to psych-pop and converges joyously in songs such as \"Blastoff\" and \"Rainbounce,\" and it's won them high fives from NPR and NME alike. Their aesthetic percolates even more vibrantly through their debut LP, Body Faucet, out May 1, 2012 on Vagrant Records. A set of shimmering sing-along anthems produced by Ben Allen (Animal Collective, Deerhunter, Washed Out), Body Faucet is propelled by jerky guitars and persistent beats. \"The record feels like a big dream with different chapters,\" says Ryan. \"Ghost Bike\" captures the space between witnessing a friend's death and surviving it. In \"Sebastian\" (named after a saint who became a gay icon), it's experiencing, then remembering, a sexual awakening with a close friend. Lyrics and music flow in a liquid form from real places, each song oozing with a different color and substance. \"We wanted to capture the thoughts we project on our surroundings and the ideas that flow in and out of us each day,\" says Graham. Indeed, much of the record deals with exploring and interacting with one's surroundings in new, occasionally frustrating, ways. The album builds with songs such as \"New House,\" expressing a future of possibilities. A centerpiece of sorts, notes Andrew, \"it's the most driving song on the record, and it's really empowering live.\" If Reptar had a superpower, it'd be the knack for warming up every space they inhabit. \"Our music is very physical,\" says Ryan. \"We always try to get people moving.\" This is wired into the DNA of the band, which honed its chops on house shows and continues to keep them a central part of its life. \u00c2 These shows began three years ago when they moved into a teetering, buttercup yellow abode together. \"It was slanted at a 20-degree angle,\" Ryan explains, \"and we'd have shows in the front room.\" Word spread, and soon they were popping up around at other houses, then clubs. Reptar even rounded out their stint at last year's SXSW by playing in a friend's backyard. Impressed by this commitment to connect, NME later rhapsodized about that bouncy set performed on a flatbed truck, anointing Reptar one of the \"biggest buzzes\" at the festival. \u00c2 \"Little kids were running around selling cupcakes to drunk people for exorbitant amounts of money,\" marvels Graham. Reptar, of course, played for free.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Phish N\u2019 Chips \u2013 FREE SHOW","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/uWsv84YRavJ95oOKHv9dxxIZG1WiHvN1ofZ1oy66rdc/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-2475_27.jpg?itok=3WYuS6_q\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/lPLeysSsf7d4P5q6dzdfQNVCPTbW_tJhaw2ieSqTIvM/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-2475_210.jpg?itok=fhYo9kMM\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-14 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"18707","path":"/show/phish-n%E2%80%99-chips-%E2%80%93-free-show-82","date_group":"2015-05-14 00:00:00","venue":"7328","body":"<p><br>\n<p>Phish N\u2019 Chips<br> every Thursday from 6pm-9pm<br> FREE ALL AGES</p>\n<p>Live Phish Tunes by<br> THE DUKES OF LIZARDS<br> feat.

Born Waylon Albright Jennings, Shooter was playing drums by the time he was five years old and had already begun taking piano lessons, only to break them off and follow his own path to an understanding of the instrument.<br> <br> He discovered guitar at 14 and rock &amp; roll (particularly Southern rock and the loose-limbed hard rock of Guns N' Roses) at 16. Soon he moved from Nashville to L.A., where he assembled a rock band called Stargunn. Stargunn earned a strong local reputation for its live shows, and enjoyed a six- or seven-year run on the L.A. circuit before Jennings rediscovered his outlaw country roots and dissolved the band.<br> <br> After a short stay in New York, where Jennings assembled material for a country project, he returned to L.A. and put together a second band -- this time with solid country roots -- which he named the .357s. Jennings and the band holed up in the studio, eventually emerging with a rambunctious country album called Put the O Back in Country, which was released in 2005 on Universal South Records. <br> <br> Following in his father's footsteps, but with his own feisty, scrappy sense of country, Jennings placed himself in a fine position to both explore that legacy and carve out his own. A second album, Electric Rodeo (which was actually recorded before Put the O Back in Country), appeared in 2006, followed by a live set, Live at Irving Plaza, later in the year. Jennings' third solo effort, The Wolf, was released in October 2007, featuring a cover of Dire Straits' \"Walk of Life\" (whose composer, Mark Knopfler, had been a longtime family friend). <br> <br> Jennings then renamed his backing band Hierophant for his fourth studio album, Black Ribbons, a concept record produced by Dave Cobb. It appeared early in 2010. Later in the year, the album was re-released in a special edition entitled Black Ribbons: The Living Album. The second version was sold on a USB flash drive in the shape of a tarot card. It featured the studio record and live performances by Hierophant. <br> <br> Jennings' fifth album, Family Man, followed soon after in March of 2012 -- minus \"Outlaw You.\" His next album, The Other Life, was released a year later on his own Black Country Rock label; it featured guest appearances from Patty Griffin, Scott H. Biram, and Jim Dandy of Black Oak Arkansas. The Other Live, Jennings' second live album, recorded during his 2013 tour and featuring many of the songs from The Other Life, appeared early in 2014, again from Black Country Rock.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script><div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Waymore's Outlaws</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.waymoresoutlaws.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Waymores-Outlaws/123365585256\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"bio\">Waymore's Outlaws consists of former members of Waylon Jennings recording and touring band, The Waylors, featuring Richie Albright, Waylon's original drummer, bassman Jerry \"Jigger\" Bridges, and steel guitarist Fred Newell.

The community was most likely founded during the Civil War era, although a few accounts hint that two families from a Daniel Boone expedition originally settled the area. Lost Cove grew into a self-sustaining, thriving agricultural community until the railroad brought timber and railroad jobs around 1910. The area became notorious for moonshining as early as 1898. Its remoteness and location along the state boundary made it difficult for tax collectors to penetrate. However, the cove\u2019s isolation, as well as economic necessity, eventually led to the community\u2019s demise. The last family moved out in 1957.

Their music feels like these two different places at the same time, but like the city that they call home, it\u2019s just two sides of one place and one sound \u2013 a sound that they can truly call their own.\u201d -Justin Green, Bear Kids Records <strong>SWEAR AND SHAKE</strong> SWEAR AND SHAKE <br> <a href=\"http://swearandshake.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://swearandshake.com/', 'http://swearandshake.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://swearandshake.com/</a> <a href=\"http://swearandshake.com/\">http://swearandshake.com/</a> <br> <code></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0r_mE-FKSo?start=144&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0r_mE-FKSo?start=144&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <br> \u201cI\u2019ve only seen a few artists bring a room to a hush, only to have their audience hooping and hollering moments later, and these four talented Yankees have joyfully mastered their ability to do so. By the end of the first song, we were out of our seats and upfront. Strangers instantly became neighbors as the entire venue was swept up in the action.\u201d \u2013 The Blue Indian Directly supporting acts like The Lumineers, Delta Rae, American Authors, G. Love and Special Sauce, ZZ Ward, and Greensky Bluegrass, Swear and Shake has gone from city to city connecting people in the same way: by taking listeners on a ride through heart-wrenching ballads, only to pick it up on the next song with something people can dance to and lose themselves in completely. Though both Kari Spieler (guitar, vocals) and Adam McHeffey (guitar, banjo, vocals) performed regularly around the campus of SUNY Purchase College, it wasn\u2019t until the final weeks of their senior year in 2010 that they met and recorded \u201cJohnnie,\u201d a song Swear and Shake performs to this day. The bedroom demo of \u201cJohnnie\u201d began to circulate, finding its way to Shaun Savage, who played bass with McHeffey all through high school, and Benny Goldstein, a fellow student at SUNY Purchase, who would later produce Maple Ridge, and ultimately come to be the full-time drummer for the band. In August of 2014 the band released its third set of recordings, \u201cAin\u2019t That Lovin\u2019.\u201d In November of 2014 the band will be relocating to Nashville, TN, to begin writing and recording their next full-length record, and to plan their next headlining tour for 2015. <strong>w/ Marty O\u2019Reilly &amp; The Old Soul Orchestra</strong> w/ Marty O\u2019Reilly &amp; The Old Soul Orchestra <br> <a href=\"http://www.martyoreilly.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.martyoreilly.com/', 'http://www.martyoreilly.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.martyoreilly.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.martyoreilly.com/\">http://www.martyoreilly.com/</a> <br> This three-man orchestra seamlessly weaves trance based blues music, harkening back to John Lee Hooker and Howlin\u2019 Wolf, with a drunken minor swing comparable to some of Tom Waits\u2019 darker works.

The history of founding members Art Neville and George Porter Jr. dates back to 1967, when keyboardist, Art recruited bass player, George, drummer Joseph (Zigaboo) Modeliste and guitarist Leo Nocentelli to form The Meters. In their 31-year history, The Meters have grooved their way around the globe. They have toured with such talents as The Rolling Stones, and have been a studio band for such diverse artists as Dr. John, Paul McCartney, Robert Palmer, and Patti Labelle. The original Meters disbanded in the late 70\u2019s. Today founding members Art Neville and George Porter Jr., are joined by New Orleans native Brian Stoltz on guitar and Terrance Houston on drums and are known officially as the funky METERS. funky METERS tap into the roots of The Meters musical heritage while taking the sound well into the future. Their trademark sound blends funk, blues, and dance grooves with a New Orleans vibe. In 1994, Art and George were joined by guitarist Brian Stoltz and Russell Batiste and officially christened The Funky METERS. This lineup carried the funk torch until the spring of 2007 when Stoltz left to pursue his solo career and Ian Neville, son of Meters founder Art Neville joined the line up taking over guitar duties. Growing up in the Neville house of music and touring with The Neville Brothers, as well Ivan Neville\u2019s Dumpstaphunk, Ian was poised to step in to help bring the band into the future. In 2011, Brian Stoltz was invited to play with funky METERS when Ian was committed to his band, Dumpstaphunk, gigs. Once the band was onstage it was as if they hadn\u2019t skipped a beat, the band and audience both knew Brian was meant to be there. After four years with Ian in the band, the time came for him to focus on his own band\u2019s success and funky METERS invited Brian to rejoin full time. The collective resume between the four artists in the band speaks volumes for the level of musicianship and creativity that comes alive when they play together on any stage. After three years of solid touring including dates at Bonnaroo, New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival, Jamcruise, The Fillmore Auditorium and countless others the funky METERS are stronger than ever. In fact, the funk is still going as strong today as it was 40 plus years ago. 200 shows, three trips across the United States and appearances at Electric Forest Festival, Bear Creek Music and Art Festival, and Wakarusa Music Festival. It\u2019s been a busy 24 months for Earphunk who have seen their efforts propel them from small club stages to packed clubs and theaters across the country. The New Orleans born-and-bred quintet shows no sign of letting off the gas, and now, with the band\u2019s third studio album release of Sweet Nasty, the band has captured the energy that has won over a rapidly growing fanbase of loyal listeners. Few bass players in the history of modern New Orleans music are as storied as George Porter Jr. During the course of a career spanning more then four decades, Porter has not only made a deep impression with his work in the Meters, but he\u2019s notched session work with artists as diverse as Paul McCartney, Jimmy Buffett, David Byrne, Patti LaBelle, Robbie Robertson, Tori Amos, Taj Mahal, Ryan Montbleau and live performances with Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Warren Haynes, John Scofield, Steve Kimock, Eric Krasno (and including recent studio releases with Warren Haynes and Bill Kreutzmann) just to name a few. Early in his career, Porter worked with seminal New Orleans artists like Allen Toussaint, Earl King, Lee Dorsey, and Johnny Adams, Irma Thomas, The Lastie Brothers again to only name a few. Porter is also the band leader of his own unique long term project the Runnin\u2019 Pardners, well respected not only as a quintessential New Orleans band, the touring band continues to receive accolades on the jam band and festival scene. He has assembled some seasoned and talented musicians to join him on this project. Familiar Pardners \u2013 Brint Anderson (guitar) and, Michael Lemmler (keyboards) and rising stars on the New Orleans music scene Khris Royal (saxophone) and Terrence Houston (drums). George Porter Jr. plans to keep a smile on his face.\u201d I feel like I am working towards something that will be remembered.\u201d</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Mason Jennings w/ WrenPop","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/yXJsoqqPZwKoF6taLSc-sPwAQuvNiPYF-Tp4Y0m0ff4/mtime:1428511888/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/63-atlg_17.jpg?itok=d3xC__Uw\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-16 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/800847","nid":"24034","path":"/show/mason-jennings-w-wrenpop","date_group":"2015-05-16 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Mason Jennings</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://masonjennings.com/home\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&amp;friendID=38984959\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/masonjennings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/masonjennings\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/43/95/63-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Mason Jennings\" title=\"Mason Jennings\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Before setting to work on his latest album, at the advice of his friend the Minnesota-based singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist holed up in the back room of his wood-nestled cabin studio with just a guitar, electric piano, bookshelf, notebook, tape recorder, and one 90-minute cassette\u2014then wrote all winter long. Emerging with the notebook and tape full of about 30 new songs, Jennings decided to skip his standard approach of self-recording and called on producer Bo Ramsey (Greg Brown, The Pines, Iris DeMent), as well as a wish-list-plucked lineup of guest musicians that includes DeMent and Neil Young drummer Chad Cromwell.

But don\u2019t dismiss him as a novelty act. He\u2019s one hell of a talent and has the music to prove it! Looking somewhat like Dracula\u2019s nasty little brother who spent some hard years drinking and working as a carnival barker for a second-rate freak show, Unknown Hinson translates that vibe to his style of country and western-tinged psychobilly. The band is now touring nationwide, wowing audiences with outrageous and campy, white-trash persona and freewheeling, sleazy tone. Hinson\u2019s most recent CD release, \u201cLive and Undead\u201d, melds weepy twang, searing guitar riffs and lyrics that speak of love-gone-bad. Recorded at a sold-out show, an enthusiastic honky tonk crowd sings along with the King on every song. Raucous, theatrical and over-the-top, Unknown Hinson isn\u2019t just for the trailer park set anymore! <br> Unknown is gaining international notoriety in the 14-34 demographic as the voice of lead character \u201cEarly Cuyler\u201d in the popular show from Cartoon Network \u2013 \u201cSquidbillies\u201d.

He is the founder and bandleader of Honeytribe, (also known as Devon Allman's Honeytribe). In addition to creating two albums and leading multiple tours across North America and Europe with Honeytribe, Devon has contributed to several other musical recordings, including Vargas Blues Band and the A Song for My Father compilation album. Devon has appeared occasionally as a guest musician for Gregg Allman and The Allman Brothers Band. His other musical projects include the blues-rock supergroup Royal Southern Brotherhood and a solo album that was released in February 2013.<br> <br> Devon is the son of Gregg Allman (of The Allman Brothers Band)<br> <br> Honeytribe[edit]<br> Main article: Honeytribe<br> <br> Honeytribe was formed by Devon Allman in 1999. In 2001, the band broke up so Allman could spend time with his newly born son. They re-formed in 2005 with their original lineup, and have since toured in the United States, Europe, and Canada, and have recorded two albums. They recorded Torch in 2006 and hit the road, playing up to 300 shows a year in 42 states and ten countries. Allman eventually grew restless with the original Honeytribe sound and pared the band down to a power trio in 2008 with bassist George Potsos and new drummer Gabriel Strange. This incarnation of Devon Allman's Honeytribe issued Space Age Blues in the fall of 2010.<br> \u00a7Royal Southern Brotherhood[edit]<br> Main article: Royal Southern Brotherhood<br> <br> In October 2011, Allman began working on a project titled the Royal Southern Brotherhood. The blues-rock supergroup includes Cyril Neville, Mike Zito.,[4] Grammy-award winning drummer Yonrico Scott and bassist Charlie Wooton. Allman was skeptical of joining the group at first, telling his manager \"Dude are you crazy? Thats like putting five quarterbacks in a room and saying 'go play football'. What the Hell are you talking about?\"[5] However he soon changed his mind and the group recorded their first album in December 2011, over five days at Dockside Studio, a 12 acre estate on the banks of Vermilion Bayou, in Maurice, Louisiana.[6] The group made its stage debut in September 2011 at the Rock \u2019n\u2019 Bowl in New Orleans.[3][6] As of September, 2012 they have toured extensively in the U.S. and fourteen foreign countries.[5]<br> \u00a7Solo[edit]<br> <br> In September 2012, Allman finished recording sessions for his first solo album, titled \"Turquoise,\" which features Myles Weeks on bass and Yonrico Scott on drums. The sessions were recorded at Ardent Studios, in Memphis, Tennessee, engineered by Pete Matthews and produced by Jim Gaines, and includes guest musiciansLuther Dickinson, Samantha Fish, Rick Steff and Ron Holloway. A solo tour began in November 2012, and the touring band include Pedro Arevalo on bass, Bobby Schneck Jr. on second guitar, and Anthony Nanney on drums. The album was released on 12 February 2013, and the track listing is: When I Left Home; Don't Set Me Free; Time Machine; Stop Draggin My Heart Around (duet with Samantha Fish [7]); There's No Time; Strategy; Homesick; Into the Darkness; Key Lime Pie; Yadira's Lullaby; Turn Off the World.[8][9][10]<br> \u00a7Other contributions[edit]<br> <br> In 2005 Allman appeared on Love, Union, Peace with bluesman Javier Vargas' Vargas Blues Band (along with Jack Bruce, Reese Wynans, and others), and in 2008 on the Flamenco Blues Experience recording by the same outfit. In 2007 Devon guested on Paris Luna's City Lights album. He has also made appearances at various festivals and on MTV Europe.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Rempis/Johnston/Ochs Free-improvising Trio!","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/Vfn_Pky3NAOZPf2-iaPiMplfJeiYJNhyiYfVTjKvqIA/mtime:1427987835/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/RempisJohnstonOchs-Photo.jpg?itok=7A2M0_zj\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-17 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/783217?utm_medium=bks","nid":"23522","path":"/show/rempisjohnstonochs-free-improvising-trio-0","date_group":"2015-05-17 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Dave Rempis \u2013 alto saxophone Darren Johnston \u2013 trumpet Larry Ochs \u2013 tenor/sopranino saxophones This free-improvising trio came together in the fall of 2011, when Rempis journeyed to the West Coast to discover some things about his compatriots on the Bay Area improving scene. Trumpeter Johnston, a frequent visitor to Chicago, where the two had collaborated in several different settings in the years prior, suggested this trio lineup for a performance at Oakland\u2019s Uptown Nightclub. Although Rempis hadn\u2019t worked with Ochs before, the latter\u2019s renowned experience in the all-horn lineup of The ROVA Saxophone Quartet made the idea especially appealing. From the first few notes, that initial meeting flowed comfortably, yet in totally unexpected ways, with all three making logical structural decisions that gave their improvisations the feel of through-composed pieces. Eager to continue developing this language that the three later came to dub \u201cinvisible architecture,\u201d Rempis made a follow-up trip to the Bay Area in the spring of 2012 for two more concerts and a studio recording session. Spectral, the first document of their work, was the result of that visit, and shows an improvising trio playing out an audible game of chess. Not satisfied with simply existing in the moment, these three combine sensibilities to look many moves ahead, setting each other up time and again to capitalize on structural possibilities that give rare and meaningful form to an otherwise very spontaneous music.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Pizza Pandamonium","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/-iCQEn2LjixmzKASgjyALxCEMMH_d1yDWRxMAPCD4Ec/mtime:1427987835/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Pizza-poster4.jpg?itok=QFOv82ij\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-17 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23977","path":"/show/pizza-pandamonium","date_group":"2015-05-17 00:00:00","venue":"7319","body":"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Event is from 5:30-8:30 PM</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"Pizza Pandamonium - Best Local Pizza Contest at Highland Brewing Company in Asheville, NC\" src=\"http://www.highlandbrewing.com/ee-images/event-images/Pizza-poster4.jpg\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 301px;\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">BENEFIT FOR <a href=\"http://www.eblencharities.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EBLEN CHARITIES</a>!<br> CELEBRITY JUDGES!<br> FREE BEER &amp; PIZZA!<br> GREAT LOCAL BANDS!</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Mining Troubadour Minds: SHAWN MULLINS","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/prZAJXTOfpyurzONfzy2LhWi9LNYRko6_Okaq2Rk2pk/mtime:1427987835/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Shawn-Mullins-featured-image_1.jpg?itok=8nY4cXs4\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-17 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=2350561","nid":"21880","path":"/show/mining-troubadour-minds-shawn-mullins","date_group":"2015-05-17 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p><strong>MORE INFO HERE:</strong> MORE INFO HERE: <a href=\"http://www.dogleapmedia.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.dogleapmedia.com/', 'http://www.dogleapmedia.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.dogleapmedia.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.dogleapmedia.com/\">http://www.dogleapmedia.com/</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.shawnmullins.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.shawnmullins.com/', 'http://www.shawnmullins.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.shawnmullins.com/</a> <a href=\"http://www.shawnmullins.com/\">http://www.shawnmullins.com/</a> <br> <a href=\"http://reaganboggs.com/blog/home/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://reaganboggs.com/blog/home/', 'http://reaganboggs.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://reaganboggs.com/</a> <a href=\"http://reaganboggs.com/\">http://reaganboggs.com/</a> <strong>Pick the brain of \u201cTroubadour\u201d Shawn Mullins.

Evidence of Mullins\u2019 newfound level of musical and lyrical ambition courses comes through with Light You Up (Vanguard Records, Oct. 12). This captivating new song cycle will likely be viewed as a flat-out revelation even by Mullins\u2019 most fervent fans. His experiences included an indoctrination into the collaborative creative process by numerous bouts of intensive co-writing, in one instance putting him atop of the country charts via a key contribution to the Zac Brown Band\u2019s \u201cToes,\u201d marking his third #1 single, following 1999\u2019s \u201cLullaby\u201d and the 2006 Triple A/Americana chart-topper \u201cBeautiful Wreck.\u201d Further co-writing yielded nine of the 11 songs on the new album, which Mullins believes represents the strongest, most expressive writing of his distinguished career. All of this creative activity was topped off by the birth of Shawn\u2019s first child, Murphy, in August of 2009. \u201cEven in the hospital with our new son, something changed for me,\u201d Mullins recalls. \u201cIt was almost like nothing else mattered. It feels that different now. And at the same time, co-writing has become a sort of community for me.\u201d These two crucial realizations are at the center of Light You Up. The new album reaches out, boldly and magnanimously, into present-day existence\u2014and at times like these, like-minded individuals can find strength in numbers. In this sense, the process that brought the new album to life parallels its underlying theme of banding together. Light You Up is an ensemble album through and through, the result of creative interaction from the writing through the recording. Tracking began with two weeks of playing and recording live at Mullins\u2019 rustic Georgia cabin with his core musicians\u2014drummer Gerry Hansen, bassist Patrick Blanchard and guitarist Davis Causey . The project continued with the addition of Hammond B3 organ and other keyboards from Marty Kearns, pedal steel from Dan Dugmore and Clay Cook, saxes from Tom Ryan, a string quartet and additional percussion. The album opens with the devastating one-two punch of the cinematic \u201cCalifornia\u201d\u2014which instantly takes its place alongside such latter-day Cali classics as Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cFree Fallin\u2019,\u201d David &amp; David\u2019s \u201cWelcome to the Boomtown,\u201d Beck\u2019s \u201cEarthquake Weather\u201d and Mullins\u2019 own chart-topper \u201cLullaby\u201d\u2014and the smoldering, zeitgeist-capturing title track. In terms of their dramatic payloads, these two songs are of a piece, delving into the tattered yet resilient heart of the American Dream. The California setting, to which Mullins returns on \u201cTinseltown,\u201d functions as a microcosm of our collective journey from wide-eyed innocence through bitter experience to the possibility of personal and collective renewal. Shawn\u2019s friend and collaborator, Nashville pro Chuck Cannon (whose songs have been cut by the likes of Dolly Parton, Merle Haggard and Willie Nelson), co-wrote \u201cCalifornia\u201d and \u201cLight You Up\u201d (the first single). \u201cChuck\u2019s one of the world\u2019s best songwriters and very old-school in his approach.\u201d Mullins marvels. \u201cA lot of songwriters will work on a song for a few hours, and when it\u2019s pretty good they\u2019ll call it quits. When Cannon and I are working, we won\u2019t leave a song unfinished. There\u2019s a lot of tweaking and fine-tuning until we know the song is right.\u2018California\u2019 and \u2018Light You Up\u2019 are very special to me; they both hint at a sort of New Babylon and where we are in America right now.\u201d Cannon also co-wrote the Civil War narrative/plea for peace \u201cCatoosa County\u201d and the topical lament \u201cCan\u2019t Remember Summer.\u201d The latter is a five-way collaboration with Edie Carey, Rebecca Lovell, and Toad the Wet Sprocket leader Glen Phillips, who\u2019s Mullins\u2019 lone co-writer on \u201cMurphy\u2019s Song.\u201d The 22-year-old Taos native Max Gomez joined Shawn in the creation of \u201cI Knew a Girl\u201d and the closing \u201cLove Will Find a Way,\u201d as well as being one of four contributors to \u201cTinseltown,\u201d along with Chuck Jones and Jeff Trott, while Shawn\u2019s longtime drummer Gerry Hansen, who doubled as co-producer of Light You Up, co-wrote \u201cYou Make It Better.\u201d Mullins borrowed the inspiring \u201cThe Ghost of Johnny Cash\u201d from co-writers Cannon (who contributes acoustic and backing vocals to the track) and Phil Madeira, and he revisits \u201cNo Blue Sky,\u201d which originally appeared on the self-titled 2003 LP from the Thorns, a harmony trio comprising Mullins, Pete Droge and Matthew Sweet, the latter bringing his signature layer-cake harmonies to the rousing sing-along choruses of \u201cCalifornia.\u201d \u201cCalifornia\u201d tells the story of a country boy from Mississippi and a hippie chick from the Pacific Northwest who first catch sight of each other in a SoCal freeway traffic jam. \u201cHer stereo was blaring Dylan/The Bootleg Sessions/And \u2018Oh the Times They Are A-Changin\u2019\u2019/Made a pretty good impression/She looked over and caught him smiling/Under the California setting sun/They fell in love on the 101.\u201d From there, the lyric follows the descent of the young lovers into the dark underside of what began as their shared California idyll in what amounts to a contemporary fable about the soul-killing temptations of the material world. The thematic thread runs seamlessly into \u201cLight You Up,\u201d with its unsettling spoken verses\u2014\u201cEverybody wants the real deal/Everybody wants to cop a good feel/Everybody wants more money/Everybody wants a taste of your honey\u201d\u2014and intense choruses, as scorching as the San Fernando Valley in August, as Mullins reaches upward to break into his thrilling falsetto: \u201cI just want to light you up/Light you up like a fire/I just want to turn you on/Turn you on and take you higher.\u201d Here, as elsewhere, a deeper perspective is embedded in the song\u2019s bridge, as Mullins sings, \u201cYeah this old world can bring you down/Turn your smile into a frown/Break your heart and make you sad/Drive you stark raving mad.\u201d Finally, the narrative drops away as the band launches into a surging extended rave-up, further deepening the song\u2019s emotional resonance. \u201cSome of the songs are set in L.A.,\u201d Mullins explains. \u201cThey\u2019re not all lyrically about Los Angeles or Hollywood, but there\u2019s a California theme that runs through the album. Even \u2018Murphy\u2019s Song\u2019 has this Bakersfield sound to it, with Dan Dugmore\u2019s classic pedal steel guitar.\u201d Dugmore was the steel player on a lot of early James Taylor recordings as well as Linda Ronstadt\u2019s \u201cBlue Bayou.\u201d Three songs later, the band pumps out a punchy midtempo groove, and Causey\u2019s shimmering guitar licks conjure up a smoggy sunset, setting the scene for \u201cTinseltown,\u201d with its memorable payoff, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna go downtown tonight/The neon burns just a little too bright/I just wanna watch the sun melt down/Over Tinseltown.\u201d The album is overflowing with perfect rhymes, telling detail and underlying intimations. This is uncommonly literate stuff, striking in its insightfulness and compassion. Delivered by Mullins in his companionable baritone, as lived-in and textured as your favorite pair of faded jeans, amid the relentless rhythms, churning Hammond organ runs and swooping guitar lines, every line is absolutely spellbinding, adding incrementally to the album\u2019s gripping intensity. \u201cI felt like I needed to get the listener\u2019s attention with this record,\u201d says Shawn. He can consider that a mission accomplished. <strong>6pm doors, 7:30pm showtime. $22 ADV, $25 day of show. ALL AGES. Seated show.</strong> 6pm doors, 7:30pm showtime. $22 ADV, $25 day of show.

For over two decades, INCANTATION has stood out as one of the most uncompromising forces in metal with their blasphemous and bone-crushing doom-tinged brand of death. Responsible for classics like Onward to Golgotha and Diabolical Conquest, INCANTATION's legacy speaks for itself.<br> <br> Throughout their illustrious career, INCANTATION has become an infamous death metal institution and a pillar of the international underground metal scene. The staggering combination of the band's ominous sound, vicious style, incredible work ethic and unwavering dedication has left an indelible mark unmatched by all except the most legendary of their peers. Arguably metal's hardest working band, INCANTATION has ventured forth like conquering crusaders, converting thousands of new fans time after time. From Canada to Colombia, Argentina to Europe, Central America to Australia and the States, INCANTATION has endeavored to reach every corner of the world. Additionally, they have given such other prestigious acts as Nile, Decapitated, Krisiun, Enslaved, and Kataklsym their first opportunities to tour on U.S. soil.<br> <br> The INCANTATION of today sees the band stronger than ever with a lineup comprised of founder/guitarist/vocalist John McEntee, longtime drummer Kyle Severn, guitarist Alex Bouks [Goreaphobia] and bassist Chuck Sherwood [Bloodstorm]. The combined efforts of all four members have resulted in an album that will undoubtedly go down as among the best in the band's history. Vanquish in Vengeance, INCANTATION's long-awaited follow up to 2006's Primordial Decimation, features over 50 minutes of the band's trademark dark and unholy death metal. Recorded at the infamous Mars Recording Compound with Engineer Bill Korecky and mixed and mastered by the legendary Dan Swano at Unisound studios, Vanquish in Vengeance deals with the numerous counts of genocide in the name of religion our society has witnessed over a millennia.<br> <br> Sherwood elaborates on the album's lyrical content, \"The concept of our world so enslaved by monotheistic dogma that only a rebirth, with nothing but distain for the previous, would be tolerated.

After an extended weekend of knocking back brews (and maybe a little blow) he met drummer Sterling Trull one morning in 6th grade. Sterling, who also had the runs from a weekend of drinking decided they should skip gym, pick up a 12 pack and start practicing. After playing KC &amp; The Sunshine Band covers in sleazy strip joints for a few years they met Jesse \"The Mexicutioner\" Gonzalez. Jesse, who was high on bath salts and pissed because a gang of third graders had stolen his taco truck knew he had found his band. With fiery vengeance they immediately began writing songs which would later be featured on their 2012 debut EP \"Disgust\".

After a few lineup changes and the constant evolution of the sound they desired Amnesis began playing shows in the spring of 2012, afterwhich they released an independent EP entitled \"Sick is the New Sane\". Following a brief period of writing and the addition of Hajji Grape on guitar and Chris Swayney on drums the band began playing shows heavily in support of the band's first single \"Ultraviolence\", a song that that captured the attention of the metal crowd an became an icon for the band. In the fall of 2013 the band picked up Ryan Welchel whos stage personality is best represented by his trademark mask and distinct military garb. This inspired Amnesis to take a different approach to their stage presence as the members all currently are represented at live shows by characters which they have manifested into, some wearing masks. Amnesis is currently a regional act and are playing shows in the Southeastern United States while finishing their first independently released full-length</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Shane Pruitt Band High energy Gospel, Blues and Rock and Roll!","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-05-18 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24278","path":"/show/shane-pruitt-band-high-energy-gospel-blues-and-rock-and-roll","date_group":"2015-05-18 00:00:00","venue":"7317","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-CarLeans/746050382142992?fref=photo\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-CarLeans/746050382142992?fref=photo</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"contra dance","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-05-18 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"21549","path":"/show/contra-dance-124","date_group":"2015-05-18 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p>Contra Dance in Asheville Monday nights from 8pm-10:30pm, featuring our great local callers and bands as well as nationally touring talent.

Releasing records on Drag City Inc, Permanent Records, Bathetic and Important Records since 2010 while also making original music scores for documentary film maker Olivia Wyatt. Bitchin' Bajas began in 2010 as a solo side project for Cooper Crain, guitarist of Chicago Krautrock revivalists Cave. The early sounds of Bitchin' Bajas were equally psychedelic but decidedly less aggressive than Crain's primary band, opting for more textural exploration than rhythmic force. The project quickly became prolific in its release of music, starting with the Tones/Zones full-length in 2010, and trickling out split singles, EPs, cassette-only releases, and the like among more actualized full-lengths every year that followed. The solo project was expanded to a duo with the inclusion of Mahjongg's Dan Quinlivan, adding more synth and guitar textures to Crain's web of spectral sound. Albums documenting the group's development arrived often, with 2011's Water Wrackets, 2012's Vibraquatic, and 2013's more fully realized Bitchitronics. Though the band had either self-released their music or worked with a variety of lesser-known indie labels, Bitchitronics arrived on indie giant Drag City.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Shana Falana w/ Morbids","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/Ax1Y0RGHo6MrWUZFBOuxF_VndikE_nPpftnmpxLNvEc/mtime:1428511888/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/shana-falana_0.jpg?itok=MfBpg5v-\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-19 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24111","path":"/show/shana-falana-w-morbids","date_group":"2015-05-19 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Shana Falana is an experimental dream-pop band emerging from New York\u2019s vast psych/shoegaze scene.

Featuring original and traditional repertoire spanning bluegrass, old-time and folk, Zoe &amp; Cloyd exudes the soulful essence of traditional American music. Both accomplished musicians in their own right, John and Natalya bring diverse and complementary skills to their collaboration. John Cloyd Miller is a twelfth generation North Carolina native and the grandson of pioneering bluegrass fiddler and NC Folk Heritage Award winner Jim Shumate. John\u2019s foundation in traditional bluegrass and old-time Appalachian music coupled with his modern sensibility and award-winning songwriting make him a natural musician and a versatile performer on a variety of instruments. Natalya Zoe Weinstein also comes from a musical family and is an accomplished fiddler in several styles as well as an inspiring singer and songwriter. While trained classically in her home state of Massachusetts, she has spent the last decade fine-tuning her bluegrass and old-time fiddling with some of the top traditional musicians in North Carolina. The duo can be found performing all across the country in addition to leading workshops on the music of the Southern Appalachians. <strong>HONEY DEWDROPS</strong> HONEY DEWDROPS <br> <a href=\"http://www.thehoneydewdrops.com\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.thehoneydewdrops.com', 'www.thehoneydewdrops.com']);\" target=\"_blank\">www.thehoneydewdrops.com</a> <a href=\"http://www.thehoneydewdrops.com\">www.thehoneydewdrops.com</a> <br> <code></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1OyCeEIMvk4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <code></code> <br> <em>\u201c\u2026.songwriting that strives to honor the simplicity of its forebears.\u201d</em> \u201c\u2026.songwriting that strives to honor the simplicity of its forebears.\u201d - <strong>UTNE Monthly Reader</strong> UTNE Monthly Reader <br> <em><br> \u201cTheir talent is such that it\u2019s quite possible that a new band recording in the year 2020 might cite the Honey Dewdrops as a prime influence.\u201d</em> <br> \u201cTheir talent is such that it\u2019s quite possible that a new band recording in the year 2020 might cite the Honey Dewdrops as a prime influence.\u201d - <strong>Bluegrass Unlimited Magazine</strong> Bluegrass Unlimited Magazine Laura Wortman and Kagey Parrish share more than most couples. As the Honey Dewdrops, they share stages from venues to festivals across North America, stretches of rolling, infinite roadway, and a lot of songs; they share one mic and a hunger to pay attention to what endures. This hunger to explore and document is evident in their 2012 release Silver Lining, a Top Ten record on national Folk and Americana stations. With tight harmonies and an musical ensemble that includes clawhammer banjo, mandolin and guitars, the effect is to leave listeners with only what matters: the heart of the song and clarity over ornamentation. After a year and a half of living on the road, Laura and Kagey now call Baltimore, MD home and it\u2019s where they wrote and recorded their fourth full-length album, Tangled Country, expected for release April 2015. The set of songs is raw and engaging, with characters and images from kindred people and places. And like their stage performance, these new songs rock and reel, and then they console you when you come back down. <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $10 ADV, $13 day of show. ALL AGES.

A classically trained pianist and percussionist, but never content to color inside the lines, he became the youngest ever to win the title of Best Scratch DJ for his home state of North Carolina - at 17. In the ten years since, he has has never stopped pushing, undergoing a full transformation into a veteran electronic producer, vocalist, and live performer.<br> <br> His self-produced 2007 debut album Melanaster was the result of meticulous bedroom alchemy, recalling a lost Radiohead LP submerged in ten feet of saltwater. The album's sound is found somewhere between the beautiful haze of early Nineties shoegaze rock (My Bloody Valentine) and early 2000's IDM (Autechre, Squarepusher). Smeared, melancholy pop songs tethered to abstract electronic rhythms, what NPR called \"gorgeously subdued glitch-pop.\"<br> <br> In 2011, Carroll truly came into his own as a producer and live performer. He developed a solo PA set to bring a more raw and improvisatory vision of his music to live audiences, combining vocals, turntables, hardware controllers, and live Moog synth. Carroll's onstage performances are exercises in understated talent that mix live vocals with stunning and unorthodox turntablist skills over a bed of sophisticated electronica. In 2012, he toured with forward-thinking producers like Shigeto, Dabrye, and Emancipator, and appeared at groundbreaking music festivals across the country (Moogfest, Decibel, Coachella). His 2012 EP R&amp;S / Cedars was featured favorably by XLR8R. In 2013, he plans to release Sings, a full-length LP that combines the best of his recent instrumental work with his considerable skills as a songwriter. Think Caribou meets Four Tet, fronted by a Ben Gibbard-esque tenor.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Vaski","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/KpIC51TdYaxg1pDBOg5VhTaBXippcOjMIu8OF3zntOc/mtime:1427987835/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/19-atlg_101.jpg?itok=9Nsq1tnP\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-21 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/815579","nid":"23206","path":"/show/vaski","date_group":"2015-05-21 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Vaski</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.vaskimusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/vaski\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/vaskimusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/vaskimusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/46/63/19-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Vaski\" title=\"Vaski\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Snapchat: Vaski<br> Weightless EP out! get it for free:<br> <a href=\"http://hotdamnlife.com/vaski/\">http://hotdamnlife.com/vaski/</a></div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Geoff Achison &amp; The Soul Diggers","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/mQa1QV4ewMrA2yKve0tSJVNBbjWZ2JKMfbAzHqoJepk/mtime:1427987836/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/default_45.jpg?itok=1euaxK0W\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-22 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"22706","path":"/show/geoff-achison-soul-diggers","date_group":"2015-05-22 00:00:00","venue":"7319","body":"<p> <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=DLSRKBJinHw\" class=\"youtube-video right\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 30px;\"> <img src=\"http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/DLSRKBJinHw/default.jpg\" alt=\"DLSRKBJinHw thumbnail\"><br> <img src=\"/_assets/images/watch_video_icon.jpg\" alt=\"watch video\" class=\"video-icon\">Watch Video </a> </p>\n<p><br> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.highlandbrewing.com/ee-images/event-images/geoff.jpg\" style=\"width: 275px; height: 234px; margin: 4px; float: left;\">Equal parts New Orleans Funk, driving Blues, jazzy Soul and outback Mojo, this is southern blues/roots music from the very deepest South \u2013 Australia.

Known throughout the world as the embodiment of New Orleans\u2019 musical legacy, Dr. John is a true icon in American culture. His colorful musical career began in the 1950s when he wrote and played guitar on some of the greatest records to come out of the Crescent City, including recordings by Professor Longhair, Art Neville, Joe Tex and Frankie Ford.<br> <br> <br> Dr. John headed west in the 1960s, where he continued to be in demand as a session musician, playing on records by Sonny and Cher, Van Morrison, Aretha Franklin and The Rolling Stones\u2019 Exile On Main St. During that time he launched his solo career, developing the charismatic persona of Dr. John the Night Tripper. A legend was born with his breakthrough 1968 album Gris-Gris, which introduced to the world his unique blend of voodoo mysticism, funk, rhythm &amp; blues, psychedelic rock and Creole roots. Several of his many career highlights include the masterful album Sun, Moon and Herbs in 1971 which included cameos from Eric Clapton and Mick Jagger and 1973\u2019s In the Right Place, which contained the chart hits \u201cRight Place Wrong Time\u201d and \u201cSuch A Night.\u201d<br> <br> <br> In addition to his six GRAMMY\u00ae wins (1989, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008 and 2013), he has received six other GRAMMY\u00ae nominations over the years. In 2006, he was nominated for Sippiana Hericane, his Hurricane Katrina benefit disc. After Hurricane Katrina, Dr. John immediately stepped up to the plate with generous relief fund-raising concerts and recordings. In 2007, he was also inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame and the Blues Hall of Fame. In 2008, he released City That Care Forgot, winning a GRAMMY\u00ae for Best Contemporary Blues Album. His 2012 release Locked Down, with Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys also won a GRAMMY\u00ae for Best Contemporary Blues Album.<br> <br> <br> In 2013, Dr. John was awarded an honorary doctorate from Tulane University alongside His Holiness the Dalai Lama.<br> <br> <br> <br> On August 19, 2014, Dr. John released Ske-Dat-De-Dat\u2026The Spirit Of Satch on Concord Records, an album in tribute to another larger-than-life New Orleans legend: Louis \u201cSatchmo\u201d Armstrong. He honors Armstrong's musical genius as well as his effervescent personality with 13 classic numbers drawn from various phases of the seminal trumpeter and vocalist\u2019s five-decade career, with Dr. John joined by a stellar supporting cast, including Bonnie Raitt, Ledisi, the McCrary Sisters, Anthony Hamilton, Shemekia Copeland, the Blind Boys of Alabama, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band and trumpeters Nicholas Payton, Terence Blanchard, Arturo Sandoval, Wendell Brunious and James Andrews.<br> <br> <br> After a half century of creating music for others and himself, Dr. John continues to write, arrange, produce and interpret with a passion that has yet to wane.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Mac McCaughan w/ Flesh Wounds","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/L0A3Pc0w0-fTBrMptGmM9lVJblet1wnCma6cTEinsK0/mtime:1427987835/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/macmccaughan_lissagotwals_horizontalplaid-copy.jpg?itok=7W5HnUEX\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-22 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/784413?utm_medium=bks","nid":"23527","path":"/show/mac-mccaughan-w-flesh-wounds-0","date_group":"2015-05-22 00:00:00","venue":"8140","body":"<p>Superchunk frontman Mac McCaughan was ready to take a collection of unused tracks he had written for various movie soundtracks and assemble a new solo album. He needed only to write a few more songs to round out what was supposed to be an invigorating power pop record. Sounds easy enough, right? However, upon employing some dusty synths on the tracks \u201cYour Hologram\u201d and \u201cOnly Do,\u201d McCaughan realized that he wanted to use the album, eventually titled Non-Believers, to explore his fascination with that early-\u201980s era of music when punk evolved into something more introspective, focusing on themes of isolation and eventually turning into post-punk and new wave. As he puts it, he was thinking about a time when bands were \u201cusing keyboards and drum machines to relate through their music a disaffection or alienation\u201d from society, school, whatever. However, what really captivated McCaughan was that these artists, particularly British bands like The Cure, OMD, and Cocteau Twins, could end up making such emotionally affecting, even romantic, music when tackling these themes. As McCaughan points out, \u201cI\u2019m constantly discovering and consuming new music, so why does an old New Order song trigger the kind of emotional response that it does?\u201d It certainly seems like he started writing a new batch of songs in order to answer that question. It also became clear that he had to scrap the original batch of songs in order to do it. Sure, the task may sound daunting for a number of reasons. For starters, there\u2019s a certain anxiety about releasing an album under his own name rather than Portastatic, his old moniker. Given that McCaughan comes from the indie and punk rock worlds, he\u2019s always shied away from the perceived hubris of putting out a record under his own name. \u201cThere\u2019s something about it that\u2019s way too \u2018look at me,\u2019\u201d the singer and songwriter admits. However, given the fact that Non-Believers is exploring such a personal set of influences, putting out an album as simply Mac McCaughan for the first time just makes sense. The record is about a fascination with art that could only be made by someone far from where you are, but who maybe shares the frustrations and awkwardness of youth. It\u2019s about \u201cthe irony that comes with being 16 and having a car but not knowing where to go in it, or having a keyboard or a guitar and not knowing how to play it.\u201d McCaughan\u2019s songwriting isn\u2019t limited to sheer nostalgia; it\u2019s also about the more relatable theme of the point when people who grow up feeling alienated and isolated have to choose if and when they are going to join the mainstream, and about the emotional journey tied to weighing those options. \u201cWhat appeals to me is songs that deal with the messiness and ambiguity that come with any transitional period,\u201d says McCaughan. When writing the songs for Non-Believers, McCaughan had a duo of fictional teen goths in mind and followed them on their journey of growing into adulthood and transitioning into a world they weren\u2019t sure they\u2019d accept. \u201cThe important thing is that they\u2019re going through it together,\u201d he says. Upon hearing the spacey opening keyboard notes of \u201cYour Hologram,\u201d it\u2019s hard to resist going on that journey with these kids.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"LANEY JONES AND THE LIVELY SPIRITS Folk rock singer-songwriter with a voice like honey whiskey.","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-05-22 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24279","path":"/show/laney-jones-and-lively-spirits-folk-rock-singer-songwriter-voice-honey-whiskey","date_group":"2015-05-22 00:00:00","venue":"7317","body":"<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/riverbankramblers?fref=photo\">https://www.facebook.com/riverbankramblers?fref=photo</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Geoff Achison and The Soul Diggers","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/HocrCtupLdFxNdSio1G4TxRSAuAFWJhoOn8wfkXwVIQ/mtime:1427987835/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/default_48.jpg?itok=dy8cZcot\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-22 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"23407","path":"/show/geoff-achison-and-soul-diggers","date_group":"2015-05-22 00:00:00","venue":"7319","body":"<p> <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=DLSRKBJinHw\" class=\"youtube-video right\" style=\"margin-top: 20px; margin-left: 30px;\"> <img src=\"http://i2.ytimg.com/vi/DLSRKBJinHw/default.jpg\" alt=\"DLSRKBJinHw thumbnail\"><br> <img src=\"/_assets/images/watch_video_icon.jpg\" alt=\"watch video\" class=\"video-icon\">Watch Video </a> </p>\n<p><br> <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.highlandbrewing.com/ee-images/event-images/geoff.jpg\" style=\"width: 275px; height: 234px; margin: 4px; float: left;\">Equal parts New Orleans Funk, driving Blues, jazzy Soul and outback Mojo, this is southern blues/roots music from the very deepest South \u2013 Australia.

Self described as an electronic band, they blend forms of rock, jazz, hip hop, dance, trance, funk, and all sorts of electronic music. Comprised of brothers Chris (guitar) and Dave Teague (drums), Ethan Riffe (bass), and Brennan Fowler (keyboards). Since playing their first show in late March 2011, they have gained a steady following and a lot of love.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"TERRAPIN BREWERY NIGHT WITH GRATEFUL DEAD CENTRIC BAND PUNCLE SAM","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-05-23 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24280","path":"/show/terrapin-brewery-night-grateful-dead-centric-band-puncle-sam","date_group":"2015-05-23 00:00:00","venue":"7317","body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.screamingjs.com\">http://www.screamingjs.com</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"Hackensaw Boys","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/hr3tqt-gcXMq9ZTyDEvvXrJEIrgSLjQ4LsXrFv9HFEY/mtime:1427987836/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Hackensaw-Boys-featured-image_3.jpg?itok=pbRpmGXg\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-05-23 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"20592","path":"/show/hackensaw-boys-4","date_group":"2015-05-23 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p><a href=\"http://hackensawboys.com/\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://hackensawboys.com/', 'http://hackensawboys.com/']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://hackensawboys.com/</a> <a href=\"http://hackensawboys.com/\">http://hackensawboys.com/</a> With feet firmly planted in the old-time song tradition, hands soiled by the dirt of rock n\u2019 roll and eyes fixed steadily on the future of real country music, the Hackensaw Boys are among the most exciting groups charting new territory in today\u2019s diverse Americana music scene. How does it work? Everybody sings a bit of lead, everybody sings a bit of harmony and most members know when to shut up. Instrumentation includes banjo, guitar, mandolin, fiddle, harmonica, upright bass, charismo (a home-made tin can contraption) and the occasional trap kit. Where do they come from? In the beginning they all lived in Charlottesville, VA, but now the members are spread throughout Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Louisana. For more than a decade, however, they\u2019ve come together to tour the United States, Europe and the U.K. and to record several critically acclaimed albums. Who are they? The group\u2019s lineup includes: <br> \u2022 Ferd Moyse (strings and horsehair) <br> \u2022 Jimmy Stelling (thumb picks) <br> \u2022 Brian Gorby (traps and sticks) <br> \u2022 David Sickmen (strings and improvised straps) What\u2019s new? When asked in March of 2012 to play a show in celebration of the life of a fallen fan in Kinderdijk, The Netherlands, the Hackensaw Boys proudly accepted. On February 15th, 2012 Ren\u00e9 Verkerk was killed in an accident by the scoop-wheel of his windmill. The weeks following his death, friends and family gathered round and found the Hackensaw Boys were a mutual passion and comfort. Ren\u00e9 was a huge fan of the band and injected most of his relationships with their music. On Thursday, May 24th, over 200 friends gathered in Caf\u00e9 De Klok, the local pub, for Ren\u00e9\u2019s celebration of life. The theme of the concert was the Hackensaw Boys\u2019 song We Are Many. From this memorial show, comes Hackensaw Boys \u2013 For the Love of a Friend, a 16 track CD including Keep It Simple and Can\u2019t Catch Me, with a 35 minute bonus DVD. 2012 also saw the release of The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 1 and The Old Sound of Music, Vol. 2, deliver original material that draws upon the songwriting talents of its members. These six-song collections are the result of recording sessions held at the decaying but comfortable Sound of Music studios on Broad Street in Richmond, VA before it moved to its new location. The recordings were mastered by Grammy award winner Charlie Pilzer at Airshow Mastering in Takoma Park, MD. As with the group\u2019s previous album, Look Out (Nettwerk Records, 2007), all songs were engineered by Library of Congress archival audio restoration specialist (and all around good guy) Bryan Hoffa. History The Hackensaws have toured with a bevy of diverse acts that were quick to embrace the group\u2019s sound and songcraft, including: The Flaming Lips, Cracker, Modest Mouse, Camper Van Beethoven, The Detroit Cobras, Cake, Railroad Earth, Cheap Trick and De La Soul. In 2003, the Hackensaw Boys were honored to serve as Charlie Louvin\u2019s backing band on that Country Music Hall of Fame member\u2019s nationwide tour. Recent History Appearances at numerous festivals including Pukelpop in Belgium, Bonnaroo in Tennessee, Bergenfest in Norway, Telluride in Colorado, Belfast Folk Festival in Ireland, Floyd Fest in Virginia, Lowlands in the Netherlands, Pickathon in Oregon, and more\u2026 Ancient History In the fall of 2000, twelve musicians and a photographer friend left the Blue Moon Diner in Charlottesville, VA in a 1964 GMC motorcoach (\u201cThe Dirty Bird\u201d) and circled the country on a six-week tour of theaters, bars, street corners and alleys. <strong>w/ Savannah Smith</strong> w/ Savannah Smith <br> <a href=\"www.facebook.com/music.savannahsmith\" target=\"_blank\">www.facebook.com/music.savannahsmith</a> <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/music.savannahsmith\">www.facebook.com/music.savannahsmith</a> <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $12 ADV / $15 day of show.

He was born in South Dakota and \u2018Outlaw\u2019 is his mother\u2019s maiden name. Sam writes original songs that seek to capture the spirit of the classic country music he learned from his favorite singers: George Jones, Willie Nelson, Gene Watson, Don Williams, Keith Whitley, Dwight Yoakam, etc. While still relatively new to the scene, 2014 has been a pivotal year for Outlaw. CMT premiered his first-ever music video last Christmas, after which his second music video became a viral hit, premiered by The Bluegrass Situation and shared by thousands in the Americana community. Word spread about Sam\u2019s self-released EP and live shows throughout Southern California and this buzz earned him a slot at The Stagecoach Festival in the Coachella Valley in April. He followed up this appearance with his Nashville debut at the world-renowned live music showcase, Music City Roots. He spent the summer writing new songs and returned to Nashville in the Fall as a featured artist at AmericanaFest. Sam has now begun tracking his new full-length album, \u201cAngeleno\u201d produced by roots music legend Ry Cooder. Some of LA\u2019s finest musicians were hand-picked for the \u201cAngeleno\u201d sessions, including Bo Koster (My Morning Jacket), Taylor Goldsmith (Dawes), Gabe Witcher (Punch Brothers), Danny Garcia (Reverend Baron) as well as Jeremy Long (pedal steel), and Joachim Cooder (drums and co-producer). \u201cAngeleno\u201d will be released in 2015. <strong>7pm doors, 8pm show. $8 ADV, $10 day of show.

Other highlights from the year included winning the for \u201cBest Long Form Music Video\u201d for the film Big Easy Express, and having their classic single, \u201cWagon Wheel\u201d, receive the RIAA\u2019s certification for selling over 1,000,000 copies. The band got its\u2019 start busking on street corners in New York state and up through Canada, winning audiences along the way with their boundless energy and spirit. They eventually found themselves in Boone, North Carolina where they caught the attention of folk icon Doc Watson while playing in front of a pharmacy. He immediately invited the band to play at his MerleFest, helping to launch their career. Shortly thereafter the band relocated to Nashville for a residency at the Grand Ole Opry, where they entertained the crowd between shows. It\u2019s been nearly fifteen years since these humble beginnings, and the band has gone on to tour the world, sell over 800,000 albums, become frequent guests on A Prairie Home Companion, and play renowned festivals like Bonnaroo, Coachella, and the Newport Folk Festival. In 2011 Old Crow found themselves embarking on the historic Railroad Revival Tour with Mumford and Sons, and Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros. This tour had the bands riding a vintage train from California to New Orleans, playing shows along the way. The magic of this musical excursion across America\u2019s vast landscape is captured in the Emmet Malloy directed documentary, Big Easy Express. Old Crow Medicine Show now have five studio albums to their name, three of which were released by Nettwerk Records \u2013 and produced by David Rawlings, and Tennessee Pusher produced by Don Was. In 2012 Old Crow released Carry Me Back, on which they continued to craft classic American roots music while pushing themselves in new directions. The band\u2019s newest album, Remedy, released by ATO Records and produced by Ted Hutt represents a new stretch of road in the timeless journey of a rambling string band.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"WOODY PINES MUDDY ROOTS RECORDING ARTIST WOODY PINES PLAYS \u201cMUSIC WITH ENOUGH SOUL TO SATISFY SATAN HIMSELF\u2026..

He grew up in music coming from a musical family. Drake started piano lessons at the age of 2 and started violin in 4th grade. His father, Paul Murphy had a studio in which he taught Drake how to use all of the equipment in order to not break it. While everyone was sleeping, Drake would go into their studio and record, but he wouldn\u2019t let anyone hear his creations. One day his father found one of his tapes, saw his potential and encouraged him to continue. He was about 5 years old. At the age of 15, Drake began to professionally record music. He caught the ear of a former J. Records recording artist. At the time, he was a solo producer and when he turned 17 he joined forces with his brother, Kent Murphy. They went by the name of Beatmizers Productions which later became Dark Matter Productions and which is currently Addor Music Group. They\u2019ve had studio sessions with notable producers such as: A-REX, Shin Hyuk, Sean Hamilton, and J Angel. When the aforementioned J. Records artist found out Drake was 15, he never called Drake back. Drake wasn\u2019t discouraged, he kept making music and submitting it to other record companies. The first record company on a major scale to respond was Atlantic Records. Drake began speaking with them, but ultimately chose to go the independent route. He wanted to have more control over his projects. Everything on Drake\u2019s debut album, Feel Better was written, recorded, mixed/mastered, and distributed by Drake. Feel Better is an independent project separate from the production of Addor Music Group. He recorded his whole album by using a smart-phone controlled app that allowed him to run his studio while recording. Drake plays over 12 instruments including: accordion, guitar (his favorite), piano, drums, bass, electric and stand-up acoustic, trombone, trumpet, and violin. He\u2019s been most influenced by Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo AKA The Neptunes, Timbaland, John Mayer, Jason Mraz, Jaco Pastorius, Pat Metheny, and his father, brother, and grandfather. <strong>POET RADIO</strong> POET RADIO <a href=\"http://www.reverbnation.com/poetradio\">http://www.reverbnation.com/poetradio</a> <code></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QsdY7zYkQ7I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QsdY7zYkQ7I?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <br> Music is magic.

What began as a collection of friends is now a four-year musical partnership about to release their second album. In 2009, Andrew Heringer, Robbie Arnett and Marlana Sheetz began making music together and added Graham Fink into the mix after moving to Los Angeles shortly thereafter. As the group made their cinematic debut album, released in 2012, Milo Greene shifted into a fully tangible being, a force created by four distinct songwriters and musicians whose collaboration consistently remains its center. Last summer, after touring extensively and playing festivals like Lollapalooza, Bonnaroo and Outside Lands in support of Milo Greene, the musicians came home and began writing new music. The band wrote separately, each constructing their own ideas, bringing in varied, individual influences, putting the pieces together as a collective. There was a unified focus on percussion and on creating more up-tempo tracks, specifically ones with rhythmic, dance-inducing grooves. \u201cThe sound has evolved, but this band is the four of us as writers and singers,\u201d Graham notes. \u201cIt\u2019s very centered both on our vocal presences and our identities as writers. We come from different perspectives so that cross-section is what makes us distinct from what we would be as individuals. It\u2019s the sum of the parts thing.\u201d The four songwriters came in with a wealth of material, eventually whittling 17 songs down to the 13 that appear on Control. There was an unintentional through line in the songs as many of the band members were grappling with the end of relationships and with what it means to come of age in a band on the road. The dark, angst-tinged subject matter is juxtaposed with the buoyant sensibility in the music itself, building a dynamic tension between what is said and how it is conveyed. The title of the album represents a spectrum of ideas, reflecting the give and take of control and the shared sense of control within Milo Greene itself. \u201cThe title speaks to the idea of the individual getting out more on this record, whether it\u2019s playing or singing,\u201d Robbie says. \u201cIt\u2019s about how we trade and share that control.\u201d \u201cControl is not specific to one thing,\u201d Marlana adds. \u201cTo some, it\u2019s about authority or domination. To others, it\u2019s about having control over your own emotions. The title means something different to each of us.\u201d Throughout the writing process Milo Greene collaborated with several mentors, including drummer Joey Waronker who has worked with Beck and Thom Yorke. Waronker played drums on several tracks on Control and helped guide the rhythms that thread through the songs. The band\u2019s longtime live drummer Curtis Marrero also helped define the rhythmic sounds. The final album was recorded in the spring of 2014 with producer Jesse Shatkin (Sia, Foster The People, Ellie Goulding) at his home studio in Highland Park over the course of two months. \u201cJesse comes from a pop and hip-hop background so he was a good person to help play with what we wanted to do with this music,\u201d Graham says. \u201cHe had a very calming, exploratory effect on us. He really helped balance the four of us and make this record flow.\u201d \u201cWith this album there was a conscious choice to push the sound of Milo Greene in new directions,\u201d Andrew notes. \u201cFour years had gone by since we\u2019d started writing the first album and naturally the music we were drawn toward had shifted as well. We ended up putting a lot of emphasis on the rhythmic foundation of the drums as well as exploring new instruments like synthesizers to fill out the sonic landscape.\u201d In the studio, the musicians wanted to ensure that each singer\u2019s individual voice had its moment. Where the four voices had always combined on Milo Greene, Control reveals each musician alone and how they all come together as one. \u201cOn The Fence,\u201d the album\u2019s debut single, reflects this aesthetic as the singers play off each other over the soaring, propulsive indie pop melody. \u201cWhite Lies\u201d relies on a soulful groove, its surging chorus driven by the song\u2019s percussive elements, while \u201cLie To Me\u201d balances a thumping beat with a lush, orchestral melody. These songs represent a more recent facet of Milo Greene\u2019s ongoing evolution: Control combines the haunting, cinematic expanse of their debut with new, energized elements, urging a more upbeat tone overall. Milo Greene has become something else entirely. \u201cThis feels like a new beginning in some ways,\u201d Robbie says. \u201cWe learned so much on the first album \u2013 about how to tour, about songwriting, about being a band. Now we\u2019ve had these experiences and everything feels like it\u2019s aligning more completely. We\u2019ve grown with our experiences. We\u2019re at a place right now where it feels new and it\u2019s exciting to see the next stage of Milo Greene.\u201d</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Phish N\u2019 Chips \u2013 FREE SHOW","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/uWsv84YRavJ95oOKHv9dxxIZG1WiHvN1ofZ1oy66rdc/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-2475_27.jpg?itok=3WYuS6_q\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/lPLeysSsf7d4P5q6dzdfQNVCPTbW_tJhaw2ieSqTIvM/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-2475_210.jpg?itok=fhYo9kMM\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-04 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"18700","path":"/show/phish-n%E2%80%99-chips-%E2%80%93-free-show-75","date_group":"2015-06-04 00:00:00","venue":"7328","body":"<p><br>\n<p>Phish N\u2019 Chips<br> every Thursday from 6pm-9pm<br> FREE ALL AGES</p>\n<p>Live Phish Tunes by<br> THE DUKES OF LIZARDS<br> feat.

After growing up around music, he set it aside to pursue his education. William received his masters in counseling and worked as a psychotherapist for several years before turning to songwriting. He truly writes the kind of songs that most songwriters dream about; brilliant, heavy, complex and intensely personal\u2026the songs are nothing short of breathtaking. Lions is a musical reflection of the personal renovation that\u2019s taken place since 2010\u2019s Gold In The Shadow. Best summed up by Fitzsimmons himself: \u201cThe last couple years have been\u2026full (kind of difficult to describe years in a single word). They have been wonderful, painful, long, incredibly brief, and more educational and rewarding than any I\u2019ve ever lived before. ??I finished touring on the previous record feeling very conflicted. The longer I\u2019m given the wonderful opportunity to write and create things, and subsequently share them with others, the more seriously and preciously I take that endeavor and responsibility. It is something I look upon with the utmost gratitude and respect. ??And yet at the same time I find myself making art in a field that is itself quite the opposite of it. I am learning that one of the most difficult things about being human is not merely facing things that you don\u2019t generally find comfortable or appropriate or even good, but actually learning how to live in the midst of it and not let it take over who you are. ??When you feel you are on a wrong-headed path, the quickest way to get where you want to go is to turn around, head back, and start again from the point you went askew. ??And so I did. I returned simply to the things, which have always brought me some measure of understanding, peace, and movement. I began to write and play music without \u201cmotive\u201d or \u201cgoal\u201d or end result in mind. The way that I wrote when I first began. There was no cartoon light bulb over my head or kitchen timer dinging to let me know I had gotten somewhere. With the stuff that matters there rarely is I suppose. But after months and months and months (and more bottles of beer and bowls of tobacco than I\u2019d care to disclose), I felt like a necessary distance had been traversed. ??Wanting to continue in this very spirit, I chose to take yet another leap. I made a list of the producers who were making the music and records that most meant something to me. With no expectation I got in touch with the person at the top of the list. And, in a few months, I was on a plane to Seattle to begin working with Chris Walla to turn these songs in a notebook into the collection I wanted them to become. \u201cLions\u201d is something I\u2019m terribly proud of and utterly connected to. It\u2019s a very personal piece to me (aren\u2019t they all) and something that I want you to connect with deeply. And I think you will. I honestly don\u2019t want to say too much about the music, because the truth is if music is of any worth, it should be able to speak for itself.\u201d</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Ruby Velle &amp; The Soulphonics + Sidney Barnes &amp; The Secret B-Sides","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/jyKzv1mi3sh5hQaIpaCdHhcosntwOV2GHiQaC9sUJk4/mtime:1427987836/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Ruby-Velle-Secret-B-Sides-featured-image_0.jpg?itok=QjUdcgdT\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-05 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=2844511","nid":"22672","path":"/show/ruby-velle-soulphonics-sidney-barnes-secret-b-sides","date_group":"2015-06-05 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p><strong>RUBY VELLE &amp; THE SOULPHONICS</strong> RUBY VELLE &amp; THE SOULPHONICS <br> <a href=\"http://rubyvelleandthesoulphonics.com\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://rubyvelleandthesoulphonics.com', 'http://rubyvelleandthesoulphonics.com']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://rubyvelleandthesoulphonics.com</a> <a href=\"http://rubyvelleandthesoulphonics.com\">http://rubyvelleandthesoulphonics.com</a> <br> <code></p>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTR_ls5a4MQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oTR_ls5a4MQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <br> Atlanta\u2019s Ruby Velle and the Soulphonics are the heirs to the thrones of the old-school masters.

A slightly younger contemporary of Smokey Robinson and Ben E. King, he\u2019s cut a lasting place for himself in soul music from the late \u201950s right into the 21st century, if not as well-known a legacy as some of his contemporaries. Born Sidney Alexander Barnes in Welch, WV, he crossed paths in high school with Marvin Gaye, Herb Feemster (of Peaches &amp; Herb), and Van McCoy, among other future music stars; passing through the lineups of various bands before he hooked up with the Serenaders, a group that held a lot of promise that somehow never got fulfilled, despite a lion\u2019s share of talent in their ranks. By 1967, he had become part of the orbit of Marshall Chess\u2019 upstart Cadet Records, within the Chess Records organization as a member of Rotary Connection; and, he also saw one of his songs, \u201cHerbert Harper\u2019s Free Press News\u201d covered by no less a figure than Muddy Waters on the Electric Mud album. But, it was principally in association with other artists, as a songwriter, backup singer, and producer, that Barnes made his impact on music over the next 20 years. By the 1970s, Barnes was riding high on the soul, disco, and funk booms, working with George Clinton, Parliament, Funkadelic, and Deniece Williams, among others, while continuing to record with Minnie Riperton. His career momentum continued into the 1980s, but slowed down in the decade that followed. By the 1990s, however, he had found his recordings and his songs embraced in England by the Northern soul boom. In March of 2001, 44 years after he started in the business, Sidney Barnes made his first visit to England as a concert artist and was accorded a hero\u2019s welcome, worthy of any Motown, Chess, or Red Bird star. Sidney will perform with the Secret B-Sides as his super rocking funk band. <strong>SECRET B-SIDES</strong> SECRET B-SIDES <br> <a href=\"http://thesecretb-sides.com\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://thesecretb-sides.com', 'http://thesecretb-sides.com']);\" target=\"_blank\">http://thesecretb-sides.com</a> <a href=\"http://thesecretb-sides.com\">http://thesecretb-sides.com</a> <br> <code></p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ycrKpv1sOM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p></code> </p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ycrKpv1sOM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe><p> <br> Known in Western North Carolina as a top Soul band, the Secret B-Sides produce \u201csolid gold baby making music\u201d for lovers everywhere.

This album finally captures the energy and excitement of his legendary live performances.\u201d <br> <br> But for Randolph, the road to Lickety Split\u2014his first studio recording in three years\u2014wasn't an easy path. Though his distinctive mix of rock, funk, and rhythm &amp; blues continued to earn a rapturous response from a fervent, international audience, he felt that he had lost some of the enthusiasm and intensity that had driven him to make music in the first place.<br> \"We just weren't being creative musically,\" he says. \"Being on the road 280 days a year, you wind up playing too much and it isn't fun anymore. Soon, you stop being that concerned about how good you can be, how important it is to create and write. You kind of lose sight of that, of being focused on your craft and spending time with your instrument. I've become more in love with my guitar now, and staying relaxed and practicing and trying to create different sounds.\"<br> <br> The new album showcases the unique chemistry of the Family Band\u2014comprised of the guitarist's actual family members Marcus Randolph, Danyel Morgan, and Lenesha Randolph, together with guitarist Brett Haas. The eleven original compositions, plus a stomping cover of \"Love Rollercoaster\" by the Ohio Players, were produced by Robert Randolph &amp; The Family Band, Danyel Morgan, Marcus Randolph, Tommy Sims, Drew Ramsey, and Shannon Sanders; engineered by the legendary Eddie Kramer (Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin); and feature special guest appearances from Trombone Shorty and Carlos Santana.<br> <br> <br> Randolph notes that the title track of Lickety Split (on which his sister sings the hook) is one of his favorites. \"What's great about that one is that it's something we actually played in church, just like that,\" he says. \"There's a section in the service called the 'Jubilee Jam Session Time,' and I can show you video where we played that very same riff.\"<br> <br> But if there's one track on the album that captures the band's new spirit, it's one that started as a jam session in a Nashville studio during a break in recording, and later came to be titled \"Born Again.\" \"It's about finding the joy again,\" says Randolph. \"At first it was more of a love song, the sense you get when you find the right person, but then as we were recording this new music with a whole new sense of direction, and feeling free again, that all came into it. It's not a religious thing, it's just new energy\u2014which is really the old energy that I had at the beginning of my career.\"<br> <br> Robert Randolph &amp; The Family Band first gained national attention with the release of the album Live at the Wetlands in 2002. The band followed with three studio recordings over the next eight years\u2014Unclassified, Colorblind, and We Walk This Road\u2014which, together with tireless touring and unforgettable performances at such festivals as Bonnaroo, Austin City Limits, and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, won them an expanding and passionate fan base. Randolph's unprecedented prowess on his instrument garnered him a spot on Rolling Stone's \"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" list, and also attracted the attention of such giants as Eric Clapton and Carlos Santana, who have collaborated with him on stage and in the studio.<br> \"What I've learned from being around those guys\u2014and you never really notice it until the moment is away from you\u2014is that it's really important to them that someone keeps original music going, that you're not just trying to be like everybody else,\" he says. \"Eric really wants to know what's going on now, he's always going 'Show me that lick again!'\u2014they're like little kids, and that's really the great part about it. It makes me think that I need to keep getting better, to stay excited and keep trying to be innovative and keep growing.\"<br> <br> Most recently, Randolph has attempted to amplify the tradition from which he came by executive producing the Robert Randolph Presents the Slide Brothers album, a recording which features some of the older \"sacred steel\" players from the House of God church who inspired him to pick up an instrument. \"This is part of my whole story, which a lot of people don't understand,\" he says. \"In our church organization, playing lap steel in church has been going on since the 1920s. These guys were my mentors, my Muddy Waters and B.B. Kings. Thinking that I started this style is like saying Stevie Ray Vaughan was the first guy to play the blues. I wanted to do this record so that everybody could understand the story and start connecting the dots.\"<br> <br> He is also taking a bold new step by remodeling an abandoned school building in his hometown of Irvington, New Jersey and opening the Robert Randolph Music and Arts Program. \"There hasn't been any arts in the schools, period, since I was in high school,\" he says. \"So my whole motivation changed to a full-on effort to get these kids into music, and also find out what other passions they have and try to offer that. These kids don't have anything to do, they don't have any hope.\"<br> <br> With a new label, a new dedication to his craft, and a new sense of responsibility in his life off-stage, it seems like Lickety Split might also represent the urgency Robert Randolph is bringing to all of his efforts these days. \"I'm still undiscovered, and that's really the best thing about it,\" he says. \"Now we have the chance to present the music right, and have the story told right, and for me to be focused on being an ambassador for inner-city kids and a role model, and also an ambassador for my instrument and as an artist. As all these things happened, it got fun again.\"</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Jason Isbell w/ Amanda Shires","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/DQcZ-rqmllnh6XbMNvx42Ufa3H4uV6pnewLNieRPcaE/mtime:1427987837/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/Isbell.web__0.jpg?itok=0xkjN6vV\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-06 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://public.ticketbiscuit.com/PisgahBrewing/Ticketing/234165","nid":"23566","path":"/show/jason-isbell-w-amanda-shires-0","date_group":"2015-06-06 00:00:00","venue":"7318","body":"<p>** PRE-SALE TICKETS ON-SALE 3/18/15 @ 10am** **GENERAL ON-SALE 3/20/15 @10am**</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Tarocco: A Soldier\u2019s Tale","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/qiwwfpXTt6rj04D-R149f8R5XTCvHVJC8NRkkt3URQg/mtime:1428600745/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/foxbeggar_324.jpg?itok=l1Ghuka2\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-06 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=3216906&partner_id=240","nid":"23674","path":"/show/tarocco-soldier%E2%80%99s-tale-4","date_group":"2015-06-06 00:00:00","venue":"7311","body":"<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9jbeKC6lD5s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>The Italian tradition of Comedia dell\u2019arte comes alive in <strong>Tarocco: A Soldier\u2019s Tale</strong>, a mesmerizing fusion of circus arts, dance, mask-and-puppet theater, original music, elaborate costumes, and intricate set pieces, all wrapped in a provocative and hard-hitting narrative.

Having been instrumental in forming a musical aesthetic often referred to as 'pub rock', 'street rock', and 'punk n roll', THE BUSINESS are indelibly marked by tales of European football games, motorbike excursions, working class triumphs, bar room theatrics, factory life blues, and of course, the unavoidable anthems of the ever-scrutinized drinking and driving.<br> <br> Since forming in 1979, the band has releases more records than even some of the most long standing punk bands, toured all over the world, released records on labels such as EPITAPH, TAANG, BYO, TKO, CAPTAIN OI! and many more, as well as having Lars Frederickson (RANCID) produce one of their records and having shared a split release with DROPKICK MURPHYS.<br> <br> Although, the lineup has changed over the years, the message and the sound has not.

The Attack is ruled by a DIY ethos and driven by a goal: to re-unite the punks and skins and hardcore kids under the same underground flag.

But once those same RIYL<br> tags have been filtered through the minds and hands and voi<br> ces of this five-piece, there\u2019s simply<br> nothing else like it.<br> The Growlers took the phrase \u201cBeach Goth\u201d as an apt desc<br> riptor of their music. Sunburned and<br> salty, that term perfectly describes their distinctive<br> melding of reverb heavy surf guitar and<br> Bakersfield-style honky tonk with \u201880s post-punk.<br> This is especially true of<br> Chinese Fountain<br> , The Growlers\u2019 fifth full-length set to be released<br> on<br> September 23rd via Everloving Records. The 11 songs found on it a<br> re some of the strongest that<br> they\u2019ve committed to tape yet; a byproduct not only of eigh<br> t years in the trenches together, but<br> finely honing their gypsy folk dirges and psychedelic sea shan<br> ties to fans at close to 150 shows<br> each year. The connection between vocalist Brooks Nie<br> lsen and guitarist Matt Taylor (the<br> principal songwriters of the group) has only grown deeper.<br> \u201cThe band played better than they\u2019ve ever played,\u201d says<br> Nielsen. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the process down<br> now. There\u2019s less screwing around to get the songs laid out<br> and we weren\u2019t waiting around for<br> take after take. We knew it and we played without much tim<br> e to spare.\u201d<br> That confidence bleeds through every track on<br> Chinese Fountain<br> , with the band assured enough<br> to layer in shades of many new influences: the loping ska<br> beat of \u201cDull Boy\u201d and \u201cGoing Gets<br> Tuff,\u201d the playful disco beat behind the title track, or<br> the Teardrop Explodes-like agitation of<br> \u201cGood Advice.\u201d<br> Not that the band left themselves much room to second-guess<br> anything. The five spent about<br> three weeks writing the tracks, and about half that tim<br> e in the studio recording them.

With echoes of The Replacements, Iggy and the Stooges and The Ramones, Broncho's exuberant ten song debut Can't Get Past the Lips is a blisteringly cathartic 20 minute flash of gritty, crunching guitar work supported by an assaultive rhythm section and made whole by songwriter Ryan Lindsey's aggressive, yelping vocal work.<br> <br> Lindsey's vocals and guitar are supported by Johnathon Ford (bass), Ben King (guitar) and Nathan Price (drums). The project began as an off-the-cuff recording session for Lindsey (who also plays keys for Starlight Mints, in addition to performing as a solo artist). He quickly laid down early versions \"Pick a Fight\" and \"Losers\" with the assistance of King (Cheyenne) and Price (Native Lights), and then sent them to Ford (Unwed Sailor), asking for feedback. Ford loved the songs so much that he suggested they begin playing shows as a band.<br> <br> \"The next thing I knew, Johnathon had a show booked in Tulsa,\" Lindsey says.<br> That first show, a manic, ultra-lean showcase of six songs that clocked in at less than 15 minutes, occurred in February of 2010, since then the band has toured across the U.S. and released their debut album Can't Get Past The Lips to international acclaim.<br> <br> Just Enough Hip To Be Woman is a bold step forward for BRONCHO. Though it certainly bears the hallmarks of their previous work \u2014 fuzzy, guitar-driven rock \u2013 the production and energy of the record moves into decidedly sleeker and decidedly more new wave directions (think Cheap Trick meets the Drive soundtrack meets every great song from Fast Times at Ridgemont High meets the greatest after-hours party you've never been to). Tracks like \"Stay Loose,\" \"NC-17\" and \"What\" are the kind of pop-rock that could have easily been beamed in from the same universe that gave rise to The Cars (or a looser version of The Strokes), while the album's first single, \"Class Historian\" \u2014 with its unstoppable \"do do do do\" vocal refrain is the kind of song that seems scientifically engineered to stick in your brain forever and is arguably best played loudly over a car stereo with the windows down and your long hair blowing in the breeze. Clocking in at just more than 30 minutes, the eleven tracks on the new record are a potent statement of intent: an effortless sounding rock record that dips its toe into a variety of different styles without ever succumbing to any of them.<br> <br> The collective talent and cumulative experience of all involved with Broncho has resulted in an album that, for all its dirty-dishwater punk roots, is a masterwork of garage/pop simplicity. Speaking of the band's reference points, Lindsey says \"We all love the way those records sound so we naturally went in that direction, as far as fidelity goes. But more than anything, it's the attitude of an era that I wasn't around for, but feel a connection with. We didn't set out to recreate a record from that era, we just took on that message and made it our own.\"<br> <br> Or, as Ford puts it: \"It's not nostalgia, it's natural.\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-support\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">The Nude Party</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-3\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.thenudepartymusic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tnpband\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/thenudeparty\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-3\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-3', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/40/31/03-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"The Nude Party\" title=\"The Nude Party\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Psychological rock from a mountain.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Glass Animals","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/norCKkQYG2L3eQ6GT33ca6f-tOSs6iP3M8b-2-x2Zno/mtime:1427987837/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/glassanimals.jpg?itok=BziSeOih\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-10 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/performanceSearch.jsp?performance_id=8704159&partner_id=240","nid":"23672","path":"/show/glass-animals-0","date_group":"2015-06-10 00:00:00","venue":"7311","body":"<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/IIA1XQnAv5s?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>Glass Animals</strong> vocalist and songwriter <strong>David Bayley</strong> draws influence for both music and artwork from his involvement in the world of medicine and neuroscience (at just 22 yrs old, he has studied both) creating a sound with it\u2019s roots spread between the electronic and live instrumentation.

It is new, bold and forceful. Channeling the rage and emotion of their tempestuous early releases into finely honed musicianship, Plowing Into The Field of Love features piano, mandolin, viola and organ atop Johan Suurballe-Wieth\u2019s razor-sharp guitars and the lolloping, synchronized rhythm section of Jacob Tvilling Pless and Dan Kj\u00e6r Nielsen. The record has a clear, uncompressed sound, and Elias Bender R\u00f8nnenfelt\u2019s desperate vocals are out front, nakedly accountable for the words. On this album, R\u00f8nnenfelt sings of what it is like to be out in the world, dizzy with its offerings, perched on a plateau of false confidence, bliss, fantasy and delirious self-denial. The autobiographical \u201cForever,\u201d for which Iceage have shared the video today, begins with a pretty repetitive motif over the words, \u201cI always had the sense that I was split in two,\u201d and climaxes with a sunburst of horns recalling South African spiritual jazz great Mongezi Feza: \u201cIf I could dive into the other, I\u2019d lose myself forever.\u201d At the other extreme, the album evokes a sort of euphoria, especially in the unexpectedly upbeat country number \u201cThe Lord\u2019s Favorite.\u201d Yet desperation and loss lurks behind. This is an album about seeing, learning, and rejecting things, in a cycle that repeats and builds. The reference points are wildly varied, but the sound is uniquely and darkly Iceage as the record fights with itself, in the story it tells, and the sound it makes. It is not, however, a remotely difficult record.

But the melodies, the harmonies and the lyrics are something else entirely. In November 2012, Driftwood started work on their third and latest CD. Despite a grueling tour schedule and very little time at home, the recordings were finished in the summer of 2013.

It is new, bold and forceful. Channeling the rage and emotion of their tempestuous early releases into finely honed musicianship, Plowing Into The Field of Love features piano, mandolin, viola and organ atop Johan Suurballe-Wieth\u2019s razor-sharp guitars and the lolloping, synchronized rhythm section of Jacob Tvilling Pless and Dan Kj\u00e6r Nielsen. The record has a clear, uncompressed sound, and Elias Bender R\u00f8nnenfelt\u2019s desperate vocals are out front, nakedly accountable for the words. On this album, R\u00f8nnenfelt sings of what it is like to be out in the world, dizzy with its offerings, perched on a plateau of false confidence, bliss, fantasy and delirious self-denial. The autobiographical \u201cForever,\u201d for which Iceage have shared the video today, begins with a pretty repetitive motif over the words, \u201cI always had the sense that I was split in two,\u201d and climaxes with a sunburst of horns recalling South African spiritual jazz great Mongezi Feza: \u201cIf I could dive into the other, I\u2019d lose myself forever.\u201d At the other extreme, the album evokes a sort of euphoria, especially in the unexpectedly upbeat country number \u201cThe Lord\u2019s Favorite.\u201d Yet desperation and loss lurks behind. This is an album about seeing, learning, and rejecting things, in a cycle that repeats and builds. The reference points are wildly varied, but the sound is uniquely and darkly Iceage as the record fights with itself, in the story it tells, and the sound it makes. It is not, however, a remotely difficult record.

The tour kicks off in New Orleans and winds its way by Amtrak train throughout the Southwest with stops in New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. Following the Rail Tour, Rising Appalachia will continue to celebrate the release of their new album with dates throughout the Northeast in May including stops in New York, Portland, Northampton, and Philly (see full schedule below).<br> <br> Present day troubadours Leah Song and Chloe Smith drew from a melting pot of genres when compiling the 15-track Wider Circles album. With influences of folk, soul, roots, world music, and poetry, the album showcases the alchemy of sibling harmonies paired with banjo and fiddle duets. Joined by full-time band members Biko Casini (world percussion) and David Brown (stand-up bass / baritone guitar), Wider Circles was inspired by folk standards and traditional hymns, old mountain odes, and activist anthems that pull equally from the swampy sounds of the bayou, the contemporary twang of the Appalachian mountains, and the beat of a global rhythm. \u201cThe album is a deep reflection of the many influences and experiences we have intimately lived and have built our songs on,\u201c explains Leah. \u201cWider Circles is a subtle and powerful folk anthem.\u201d<br> <br> The album\u2019s release also signifies a new chapter in Rising Appalachia\u2019s \u201cSlow Music Movement\u201d approach to touring - an effort to promote sustainable touring practices and to be immersed in local communities. \u201cIt\u2019s an effort to take the glitz and glam out of the music industry and bring performance back to its roots. A place where musicians are not just part of fast-paced entertainment, but instead influence the cultural shift as troubadours, activists, and catalysts of justice,\u201d explains Leah. The \u2018Slow Music Movement\u2019 encourages musicians to try out \u2018non-industry standard\u2019 ways of bringing music into the world by \u201clinking to local communities and staying with local friends; pursuing alternative venues for performances and supporting local businesses with farm-to-table hospitality; providing local non-profits at each show a platform to display information; exploring alternative methods of travel including train, bike, low impact vehicles, boat, horse, or simply focusing on regional touring; and encouraging concert goers to take in more than just the catharsis of the music.\u201d</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Tab Benoit","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/SrS8nHGoK4XSWhXsWZ4EpslOklfYVPq6cIclkQyN510/mtime:1424384029/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/53-atlg_8.jpg?itok=A-_BgHId\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-14 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/785271","nid":"21643","path":"/show/tab-benoit-1","date_group":"2015-06-14 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Tab Benoit</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.tabbenoit.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"myspace\"><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/tabbenoitblues\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">MySpace</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/TabBenoit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tabbenoit\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/22/67/53-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Tab Benoit\" title=\"Tab Benoit\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">3 X Grammy Nominated, 4 X Blues Music Awards \"Entertainer of the Year\" and 5 X \"Contemporary Male\" Blues Music Award Winner the Legendary Tab Benoit.<br> <br> Tab Benoit's latest Studio Release<br> <br> \"MEDICINE\" the long awaited studio recording by Tab Benoit will be released on Telarc International / Concord Music Group in April 2011.<br> <br> The 11 song \"MEDICINE\" was co- produced by Tab Benoit / Anders Osborne and engineered by David Z at Dockside Studio in Maurice, LA.

He\u2019s a musical universe unto himself, expanding at a nearly immeasurable rate, ever more hard to define \u2014 as a mind-blowing guitarist, a dazzling songwriter and engagingly soulful singer. With his debut album Blak And Blu he has just become the first artist ever recognized by the Recording Academy with Grammy Award nominations in both the rock and R&amp;B categories for the same album in the same year, winning the latter: Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance\u201d \u2013 \u201cPlease Come Home\u201d (from the album Blak And Blu). And the day after claiming those honors he provided one of the highlights of the highlights-filled \u201cThe Night That Changed America: A Grammy Salute to the Beatles,\u201d with sparks flying as he dueled with Joe Walsh on an incendiary \u201cWhile My Guitar Gently Weeps,\u201d Dave Grohl behind them pounding the drums.</p>\n<p>But that barely scratches the surface. The album\u2019s a rocket ride from the Mississippi Delta of a century ago to multiple points still out beyond the horizon. Rock and R&amp;B sure, but blues, soul, pop, psychedelia, punk and hip-hop are also in Clark\u2019s expansive musical embrace and insatiable hunger for inspiration, which he\u2019s internalized into music all his own. And his two acoustic blues performances on the soundtrack album for the acclaimed movie 12 Years a Slave show the distinct talent and personality he brings to his music.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://garyclarkjr.com\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://garyclarkjr.com', 'garyclarkjr.com');\" target=\"_blank\">garyclarkjr.com</a></p>\n"},{"node_title":"contra dance","image_imported":"","image":null,"date":"2015-06-15 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"22395","path":"/show/contra-dance-131","date_group":"2015-06-15 00:00:00","venue":"7312","body":"<p>Contra Dance in Asheville Monday nights from 8pm-10:30pm, featuring our great local callers and bands as well as nationally touring talent.

The majority of his ten full-length albums have the psychedelic soul of New Orleans garage R&amp;B filtered through a tough distorted Hammond B-3 and a cache of self-made electronic instruments. He has also released strange soundscapes based on inner-city field recordings of frogs and neighborhood ambiance. Quintron regards his most significant creation to be his patented instrument called the DRUM BUDDY, a light activated analog synthesizer that creates murky, low-fidelity, rhythmic patterns. (Notable DRUM BUDDY clients include performers Nels Cline of Wilco, Laurie Anderson, and Mr. Dibbs.) Miss Pussycat, otherwise known as Panacea Theriac, is a New Orleans based puppeteer. Born in Antlers, Oklahoma, she began learning puppetry at the Christian Puppet Youth Ministry at the First Baptist Church of Antlers. She began her professional career in New Orleans and assisted in founding the influential night club \u201cPussycat Caverns.\u201d For the past fifteen years she has traveled internationally conducting puppet shows in rock clubs and at international festivals. She is the President of Rhinestone Records and produces vinyl LPs of her puppet\u2019s many bands. Her three full-length puppet movies, North Pole Nutrias (2002), Electric Swamp (2005), and most recently Trixie and The Treetrunks (commissioned by Vice magazine in 2007), have featured the voices of numerous New Orleans musical, political, and literary celebrities, including Sheriff Harry Lee, seafood entrepreneur Al Scramuzza, Antoinette K-Doe, and Andrei Codrescu. The Quintron and Miss Pussycat live show is one of barely controlled electronic chaos, \u201cSwamp-Tech\u201d dance beats, small explosions, clothes, and entertaining puppet stories. You can experience them live at their own secret club, the Spellcaster Lodge in New Orleans or on one of their many tours around the world. This act somehow has equal relevance in sleazy nightclubs, pizza restaurants, and university lecture halls.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Betty Who w/ Coin","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn4.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/L9dfdxrB8HAdYqFnae1Z-uRcYrhqSfI-vvTAhYHt88U/mtime:1428511890/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/43-atlg_11.jpg?itok=xBaY6RLE\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-16 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24032","path":"/show/betty-who-w-coin","date_group":"2015-06-16 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Betty Who</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.bettywhothemovement.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bettywhomusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/bettywho\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/48/64/43-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Betty Who\" title=\"Betty Who\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Betty Who blends indie and pop music into an irresistible mix of bold soundscapes, Top 40 hooks, and knowing lyrics.

The band specializes in complete, start-to-finish album performances of masterpieces such as \u201cAbbey Road\u201d, \u201cMagical Mystery Tour\u201d, \u201cRubber Soul\u201d, \u201cRevolver\u201d and \u201cSgt.

Rather, this show is about bringing to life some of the more mature and complex Beatles material in a raw &amp; spirited fashion, while remaining true to the original recordings.

It was that realization that led the acclaimed songwriter to find the only English-speaking therapist in Valencia, Spain\u2014the small town on the Mediterranean coast where he's lived for the last decade with his family\u2014and face his anxiety head-on.<br> <br> \"While I was writing these songs, I was having a mid-life crisis I guess,\" Rouse says. \"I'd been living in a different country for a long time, and becoming a father and being someone who travels a lot, I was having a hard time.\"<br> <br> In his sessions, Rouse was introduced to Gestalt Therapy, which focuses on fully experiencing the present moment and the thoughts and feelings it encompasses, with the belief that growth and change come about from a total acceptance of one's current reality rather than a pursuit of an alternate one.<br> <br> \"I started going back through my past and my childhood,\" the Nebraska native explains, \"growing up and moving around a lot and never really having a father figure, per say. All those things came out in this new set of songs. This is my surreal, ex-pat therapy life album.\"<br> <br> It's also one of the finest collections in a celebrated career that's earned him plaudits everywhere from the NY Times to NPR for his \"pop-folk introspection\" and \"string of remarkable records.\" Hailed for his \"sharp wit\" by Rolling Stone and as \"a talent to outrank Ryan Adams or Conor Oberst\" by Uncut, Rouse has long since solidified his status as a songwriter of the highest caliber over his ten preceding studio releases. Q called his acclaimed critical breakout album '1972\u2032 \"the most intimate record of the year,\" EW dubbed the follow-up album 'Nashville' \"persistently gorgeous,\" and PopMatters called his most recent record, 2013\u2032s 'The Happiness Waltz,' \"a big contender for Rouse's best work.\" In 2014, he won a Goya Award (the Spanish equivalent of an Oscar) for best song for \"Do You Really Want To Be In Love,\" from the film 'La Gran Familia Espa\u00f1ola.' But as he navigated the unfamiliar terrain of his forties while writing 'The Embers of Time,' Rouse found himself facing difficult questions.<br> <br> Album opener \"Some Days I'm Golden All Night\" finds comfort in accepting that there are no easy answers.<br> <br> \"I think I had been talking to my therapist about it, and he was like, 'It's OK to feel like shit,'\" says Rouse. \"There's a lot of emphasis out there on this kind of fake positivity, but if you feel bad you feel bad, and this song is about having good days and bad days just like everybody experiences.\"<br> <br> The album's laidback, countrypolitan vibe\u2014captured in part in Rouse's studio in Valencia and in part in his former American home base of Nashville with producer Brad Jones\u2014continues on \"Too Many Things On My Mind,\" which was inspired by economist E.F. Schumacher's book 'Small Is Beautiful.'<br> <br> \"It's a book on economics,\" explains Rouse, \"but it was written in the mid-70\u2032s and predicts what's going on today with globalism and where we're at in the world right now with consumerism and technology. That song is about downshifting and trying to live a bit more simply.\"<br> <br> \"Taking care of loved ones / hanging out with friends / some big ideas going through their heads,\" he sings. \"Can we recover what's been lost / So many people living in the box / Turn on your TV and stay offline / Too many things on my mind.\"<br> <br> Simplification is a recurring theme on the album, as the pedal steel and harmonica drenched \"New Young\" finds Rouse \"making plans to move out to the country,\" and \"Crystal Falls\" is propelled by uncomplicated rhythm from an unexpected source.<br> <br> \"That song feels very childlike,\" says Rouse, \"and that's because my two-year-old son has a drum kit. He was banging on it and playing this beat, and I started playing along with it, and the initial idea for 'Crystal Falls' came out.\"<br> <br> Fatherhood influences Rouse's writing throughout the album. \"Just the other day I stopped by my stepfather's grave / He died at 30 way too soon I forgot his face,\" he sings on the delicate, mandolin-flecked \"Time.\" The reminder prompts him to contemplate his own mortality and how to make the most of his days on Earth with his own kids.<br> <br> \"It's wonderful to bring my kids up around music and for them to have a father that does something different,\" says Rouse, \"but at the same time, there's a sense of responsibility that can be overwhelming, especially having a career that's as unstable as music.\"<br> <br> \"How am I gonna tell another story / How am I gonna live another line? / Gotta wake up early in the morning / Take the kids to school by nine,\" he sings on \"Worried Blues,\" a JJ Cale-inspired, tongue-in-cheek look at his unusual lifestyle.<br> <br> \"I've always been a fan of JJ Cale, and when he passed away it seemed like an appropriate time to give a nod to him,\" says Rouse. \"The song is about being worried about things I shouldn't be worried about, but I didn't want the record to come off as overly serious, so it was important to me that songs like this have a sense of humor to them.\"<br> <br> That sense of humor sustains Rouse as he faces down some of life's biggest questions on this record with grace and humility. \"Am I a hunter or a fox?\" he sings on \"Pheasant Feather.\" 'The Embers Of Time' suggests that Rouse has discovered he may never know the answer, and that's just fine.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Walter Martin</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-2\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.waltermartinmusic.com/Listen\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/waltermartinmusic\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n<li class=\"twitter\"><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/WaltRMartin\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-2', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"bio\">\"It wasn't that I wanted to write songs to suit my new situation as a parent. It was more that parenthood made relevant writing the kind of songs I've always loved most.\"\u2014Walter Martin<br> <br> Walter Martin, multi-instrumentalist from the Walkmen, found out his wife was pregnant with their first child just as the New York band was finishing work on their 2012 album Heaven. With fatherhood on the horizon, and adulthood an undeniable reality, Martin felt it was time to challenge himself a bit. He had co-written songs for the band since they had formed in 2000\u2014at first writing their big drum beats and rock riffs, and later focusing more on lyrics and the band's more romantic material. Now he just wanted to write something for himself. It was while standing in his kitchen the summer before last, surrounded by his young family and listening to their collection of 1950s rock 'n' roll records, that he realized what that meant exactly.<br> Read More<br> 'We're All Young Together,' Martin's debut solo effort, is a sweet, funny, rough-around-the-edges \"family record,\" as he likens it, that's intended to entertain the little ones, while getting a laugh out of their parents. An album of alphabet songs, it is not. Inspired by early rock 'n' roll, it is filled with the kind of innocent yet mischievous music that has long struck a chord with Martin. \"I'm calling it 'family music' because I want families to enjoy it together,\" explains Martin. \"But to me it's just rock 'n' roll done the old-fashioned way.\"<br> <br> Family, love, childhood, and zoo animals. Such are the classic themes of the album, all articulated by an offbeat narrator who parents can relate to. Among the songs' subjects: the virtues of rattlesnakes, the not-so-surprising similarities of siblings, and the distinguishing features of each Beatles band member. \"Above all I wanted this album to be warm and sincere,\" says Martin. \"I wanted it to make people of all ages feel good.\"<br> <br> And putting it together was a family affair, of sorts. Friends and fellow musicians Karen O, Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs), Matt Berninger (The National), Alec Ounsworth (Clap Your Hands Say Yeah), Kat Edmonson, and Hamilton Leithauser (Martin's Walkmen bandmate and cousin) all leant vocals, and, in Zinner's case, guitar work to the album. When it came to the accompanying drawings, Martin enlisted Marcellus Hall, a children's book illustrator and artist for The New Yorker. But perhaps more importantly, notes Martin, \"he's an old friend too.\"</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"WNC Highlands Celtic Festival","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/sT-O40dX0anN1ZTyUBhAWz5dWYiJhYbtKYWhkX1qzrk/mtime:1428511890/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/wnc_celtic_0.gif?itok=hFUyobeV\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/_AM9x90az6lBl-0-MbDAanS-k395WmckUPejeYf3FJ4/mtime:1428600745/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/wnc_celtic_14.gif?itok=0CkDqlNo\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-19 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"24209","path":"/show/wnc-highlands-celtic-festival-1","date_group":"2015-06-19 00:00:00","venue":"7319","body":"</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://www.highlandbrewing.com/ee-images/event-images/wnc_celtic.gif\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 251px;\"></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">More music, venors and entertainment!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Check back soon...</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Ohio Players","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn1.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/aJF5GDLh-mU4FN1J5VrjhEQWswgRTTwLH2D46h7XC8k/mtime:1423259640/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/35-elg_6.jpg?itok=qn_uaYJD\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-20 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":"https://www.ticketfly.com/purchase/event/774723","nid":"20785","path":"/show/ohio-players","date_group":"2015-06-20 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Ohio Players</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.loverollercoaster.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n<li class=\"facebook\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/OhioPlayers\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/39/25/31-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Ohio Players\" title=\"Ohio Players\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">The Ohio Players came into musical prominence in the 1970\u2019s as pioneers of street funk and underground R&amp;B.

Not only is this 9 piece instrumental band regarded as one of the most exciting and innovative in Norway, the members are all involved in other musical projects and have in one way or another contributed to almost every significant recording to come out of that part of the world in the last few years. It has been this strong involvement with different projects, and different musical styles and sounds which is the key to the unique sound of Jaga Jazzist. With no boundaries and an arsenal that includes trumpet, trombone, electric guitars, bass, tuba, bass clarinet,saxes, keyboards, vibraphone and a rack of electronics, Jaga Jazzist create timeless music. Melodic, hypnotizing, delicate and subtle.<br> <br> Jaga Jazzist started out in Tonsberg (a small town outside Oslo) in 1994 at which time Lars Horntveth (the main songwriter in Jaga) was only 14 years old! In 2001 they released their debut album \"A Livingroom Hush\" on Warner in Scandinavia to massive critical acclaim and great sales (the album sold over 15000 copies in Norway alone..). The band then signed a deal for the rest of the world through Oslo`s Smalltown Supersound. Throughout 2002 the band shocked fans and critics alike with their blistering live shows and the buzz resulted in sold out dates all over Europe and the band soon came to the attention of Ninja Tune who did a license/collaboration deal with Smalltown Supersound.<br> <br> At the same time that their debut album was gaining more and more international success, Jaga recorded the follow up titled \"The Stix\", their first for Ninja Tune. As with their first album it was produced by Norwegian superproducer J\u00f8rgen Tr\u00e6en the man behind Duper Studios in Bergen (home of R\u00f8yksopp, Kings of Convenience, Sondre Lerche et.al.) but this time Jaga wanted to push their musical limits even further and really create a sound they could genuinely call \"Jaga Jazzist \". It was the perfect balance between (hu)man and machine, and it never lost the organic nature of a live 10 piece.<br> <br> After heavy touring next came their most radical \"What We Must\" album, the result of the band going into an isolated studio out in the Norwegian woods and recording the demo now known as the Spydeberg Session. Put down in one take in one day, it was a breakthrough moment for the group. A sound that was closer to their live sound than ever before. It was their rock album. But of course Jaga's own kaleidoscopic take on rock stylings, rolling from early 90s British shoegazer guitar pop to 70s prog rock, all shot through with Jaga's own unique logic.<br> <br> And now this takes us to their 6th album, \"One Armed Bandit\", due for release in January 2010. Lars Horntveth began writing the music in early 2008. Alongside two new band members \u00d8ystein Moen-keys and Stian Westerhus-Guitar, JAGA rented A house in the Swedish forest to rehearse new material. It could be said that it was a reaction to \"What We Must\". It does include the rock stylings of \"What We Must\" and the electronics of \"The Stix\" but is still very much looking forward with a new sound. The breakthrough moment was the track \"One Armed Bandit\", the first single from the album of the same name. Taking influence from the afro-beat stylings of Fela Kuti but funneled through their own style. The Wagner-Esque fanfares and arpeggios are intended to sound like slot machines. And this Wagner meets Fela Kuti sound became a kind of theme of the album. In December 2008 the band went to Cabin Recorders to record the album with J\u00f8rgen Tr\u00e6en, a man who had been a big factor in forming Jaga\u00b4s music since A Livingroom Hush and the Stix, Unfortunately after 3 weeks Tr\u00e6en got tinnitus. Jaga quickly thought of John McEntire of Tortoise fame. He was enthusiastic about mixing it and in April 2009, 3 members of the band went to Soma Studio in Chicago to mix the album. Interestingly one day the Norwegian garage jazz band \"The Thing\" were playing at a local jazz club. Jaga went down there with a microphone and laptop and recorded what was to be the intro of the album.<br> <br> At heart of this collective is a restless soul, going in many directions at the same time, but always going forward. Fast. The band always pushing their boundaries, both personal and musical. That is why they are impossible to categorize. And that's why they're special. Jaga is something natural and beautiful. A necessity. For both them and us.</div>\n</div>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function($) { $('.artist-boxes .video, .artist-boxes .audio').bind('dialogclose', function(event, ui) { $(this).html($(this).html()); }); }); </script></div>\n"},{"node_title":"Girls Rock Asheville!","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/JViVCjgYyXXA2UCYlcu5-2guYkocWDB8fy4SGe3UiSQ/mtime:1420842916/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/27-elg_0.jpg?itok=VwFw3umG\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-23 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"19729","path":"/show/girls-rock-asheville-2","date_group":"2015-06-23 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Girls Rock Asheville</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.girlsrockasheville.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/35/16/25-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Girls Rock Asheville\" title=\"Girls Rock Asheville\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Girls Rock Asheville (GRAVL) is a nonprofit camp dedicated to empowering girls, trans* youth and<br> ladies of all backgrounds and abilities through music education.

He played it for his older brother, Oliver, who\u2019d had a verse lying around he didn\u2019t know what to do with. The two pieces, composed months apart, one in urban Atlanta and the other deep in the Catskills, dovetailed musically and lyrically: the verse about a man regretting chasing unattainable women, the high-lonesome, harmony-driven refrain of \u201cWhen I die, I wanna be sent back to try, try again.\u201d \u201cNeon Tombstone\u201d wasn\u2019t the first song that Chris, a founding member of jazz trio Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, and Oliver, formerly Tinsley Ellis\u2019s guitarist, had written \u2014 since 2006, they\u2019d released three studio albums of Americana as The Wood Brothers. But it was the first one they\u2019d written like this. \u201cThis is how a song is supposed to come together,\u201d Oliver remembers thinking. \u201cThere was some chance, some randomness, to it.\u201d The experience marked a deeper level of collaboration for The Wood Brothers, a newfound fraternal synchronicity that\u2019s captured on their latest album, \u2018The Muse.\u2019 Within the first few bars of opener \u201cWastin\u2019 My Mind,\u201d which could pass for a lost cut from \u201cThe Last Waltz,\u201d it\u2019s clear the brothers are operating on a different plane than when we last heard them, on 2011\u2019s \u2018Smoke Ring Halo.\u2019 The components are similar: the dialed-in vocal harmonies, Oliver\u2019s gritty acoustic guitar, Chris\u2019s virtuosic upright bass, the warrior poet lyrics. But here there\u2019s a glue \u2014 a yellowy carpenter\u2019s glue, one imagines \u2014 holding it all together. The cohesion comes from the brothers having spent the last two years on the road with new full-time member Jano Rix, a drummer and ace-in-the-hole multi-instrumentalist, whereas they relied on session musician-friends to fill out previous albums. Jano\u2019s additional harmonies give credence to the old trope that while two family members often harmonize preternaturally, it takes a third, non-related singer for the sound to really shine. And then there\u2019s Jano\u2019s work on his literally patented percussion instrument, the \u201cshuitar,\u201d a shitty acoustic guitar rigged up with tuna cans and other noisemakers, which, in his hands, becomes a veritable drum kit. Starting with debut \u2018Ways Not To Lose,\u2019 which NPR described as a collection of \u201cgracious little songs [that] sound like they were born on a front porch during a beautiful sunset,\u201d The Wood Brothers have made albums like you\u2019re not supposed to anymore \u2014 recording mostly live, warts and all. But on \u2018The Muse,\u2019 they double down on the production values of a purer time. Whereas \u2018Smoke Ring Halo\u2019 was tracked with the musicians playing in separate rooms, here Chris, Oliver and Jano often circled around a tree of microphones, a couple feet apart from one another, and simply played the songs, with even the lead vocals being recorded on the spot. The arrangement is a producer\u2019s nightmare \u2014 the different sounds bleed into the various mics, limiting mixing options and ruling out the possibility of fixing mistakes \u2014 but the band had two willing accomplices: legendary country musician Buddy Miller, who produced the album, and Nashville studio vet Mike Poole, who engineered. \u201cI just love how Mike and Buddy really embraced that idea,\u201d Oliver says. Miller, an award-winning producer, guitarist and solo artist, has performed and recorded with icons such as Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss. Oliver continues, \u201cI hear little things that are out of tune or imperfect, and I love it. That\u2019s what I like about old recordings \u2013 they just did it, and that\u2019s what happened.\u201d From early in their childhood in Boulder, CO., Chris and Oliver were steeped in American roots music. Their father, a molecular biologist, would perform classic songs at campfires and family gatherings, while their mother, a poet, instilled a passion for storytelling and turn of phrase. The brothers bonded over bluesmen like Jimmy Reed and Lightnin\u2019 Hopkins, but their paths, musical and otherwise, would diverge. Oliver moved to Atlanta, where he played guitar in cover bands before earning a spot in Tinsley Ellis\u2019s touring act. At Ellis\u2019s behest, Oliver began to sing and then founded King Johnson, a hard-touring group that would release six albums of blues-inflected R&amp;B, funk and country over the next 12 years. Chris, meanwhile, studied jazz bass at the New England Conservatory of Music, moved to New York City and, in the early \u201890s, formed Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, which over the next two decades would become a cornerstone of contemporary jazz and abstract music. After pursuing separate musical careers for some 15 years, the brothers performed together at a show in North Carolina: Oliver sat in with MM&amp;W following King Johnson\u2019s opening set. \u201cI realized we should be playing music together,\u201d Chris recalls. Soon after, the pair recorded a batch of Oliver\u2019s songs, channeling the shared musical heroes of their youth while seizing on their own individual strengths \u2014 Oliver\u2019s classic songwriting, Chris\u2019s forward-thinking musicianship. A demo landed them a record deal with Blue Note, who released \u2018Ways Not To Lose\u2019 in 2006. Follow-up \u2018Loaded\u2019 came in 2008; after covers EP \u2018Up Above My Head\u2019 the next year, the band moved to Zac Brown\u2019s Southern Ground Artists for \u2018Smoke Ring Halo\u2019 and then 2012\u2019s \u2018Live, Volume One: Sky High\u2019 and \u2018Live, Volume Two: Nail and Tooth.\u2019 On \u2018The Muse,\u2019 following the opening one-two of \u201cWastin\u2019 My Mind\u201d and \u201cNeon Tombstone,\u201d the album shuffles between bluesy, classic country and swampy funk, mining the brothers\u2019 timeless influences (Robert Johnson, Willie Nelson, Charles Mingus) while sounding fresh enough to win over fans of today\u2019s mainstream roots-music acts (The Avett Brothers, Mumford &amp; Sons). The title track shows Oliver\u2019s songwriting at its most tender and autobiographical to date, as he sings of his \u201cfinest work yet\u201d \u2014 his newborn child \u2014 in his endearingly offbeat voice, which The New York Times calls \u201cgripping.\u201d Chris takes the vocal lead on \u201cSweet Maria\u201d and \u201cLosin\u2019,\u201d and capably so, while on his standup bass, he\u2019s often playful, even rascally, imbuing the songs with humor with his warm, unpredictable notes. Jano, when not banging on his shuitar, adds refreshing flourishes of piano and melodica. \u2018The Muse\u2019 marks another milestone for The Wood Brothers: it\u2019s the first full-length they\u2019ve recorded at Southern Ground Studios in Nashville. In the way that Manhattan becomes its own character in an old Woody Allen movie, the live room at Southern Ground plays a key role on the album, making its warm presence felt throughout. (There\u2019s even a little hiss from the analog tape machine.) The choice of location was practical, given Nashville\u2019s rich history and network of musicians, but also symbolic: The Wood Brothers are now officially a Nashville-based band, with Oliver having relocated in 2012, and Chris recently following. It\u2019s the first time the brothers have lived in the same city since they left their parents\u2019 nest; both are eager, along with Nashville local Jano, to plumb the sense of collaboration they tapped into during the fateful \u201cNeon Tombstone\u201d writing session. As Oliver says of \u2018The Muse,\u2019 \u201cThis is the first record that really feels like a band record. It\u2019s taken years for us to really feel like we can collaborate, and I think this is the pinnacle of it so far.\u201d Whether they\u2019re tilling a field or digging deeper into their unique blend of rock and bluegrass, the members of Acoustic Syndicate have a distinct way of reaching back in order to move forward. With their evocative new album Rooftop Garden, the quintet takes a giant leap into the next chapter of their 20-year history of making unforgettable music, working the family farm and advocating for the environment. If there was ever a band that could capture the universal truths of life from the roots up, it\u2019s Acoustic Syndicate. \u201cIt\u2019s been eight years since we made our last record,\u201d said singer/guitarist Steve McMurry. \u201cWith the passage of time, if we are paying any attention at all, we see just how fragile and tenuous human life really is. It gives you a strong sense of the incredible importance of community, family and love. These feelings come out in our writing.\u201d</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Girls Rock Asheville!","image_imported":"","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/JViVCjgYyXXA2UCYlcu5-2guYkocWDB8fy4SGe3UiSQ/mtime:1420842916/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/27-elg_0.jpg?itok=VwFw3umG\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-06-25 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"19727","path":"/show/girls-rock-asheville-0","date_group":"2015-06-25 00:00:00","venue":"17713","body":"<div class=\"artist-boxes\">\n<div class=\"artist-box-headliner\">\n<div class=\"artist-headline\"><span class=\"artist-name\">Girls Rock Asheville</span></div>\n<div id=\"tfly-more-1\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<ul class=\"tfly-more\">\n<li class=\"web\"><a href=\"http://www.girlsrockasheville.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<ul class=\"links\">\n<li><a href=\"#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"more\" onclick=\"return tfly_show_dialog(this, 'tfly-more-1', 'Web');\">Links</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p> <img class=\"bio-image-right\" src=\"//cdn.ticketfly.com/i/00/01/35/16/25-atsm.jpg\" alt=\"Girls Rock Asheville\" title=\"Girls Rock Asheville\"><br />\n<div class=\"bio\">Girls Rock Asheville (GRAVL) is a nonprofit camp dedicated to empowering girls, trans* youth and<br> ladies of all backgrounds and abilities through music education.

He knows how it can inspire, uplift and make people want to dance or cry. He felt it firsthand recently when he heard the children\u2019s chorus at New York\u2019s PS22 elementary school singing \u201cI\u2019m Alive (Life Sounds Like),\u201d the celebratory first single from Franti\u2019s tenth studio album, All People. <br> <br> \u201cIt moved me to tears, to hear these kids singing, \u2018Everybody wants me to be who they want me to be.\u2019 That\u2019s who I wrote \u2018People\u2019 for. To let them know, your mission in life should be to be yourself and to embrace the diversity of others.\u201d<br> <br> It\u2019s a rule the barefoot, 6-foot-6 San Francisco based singer-songwriter-guitarist and philanthropist has diligently followed over the past two decades, proactively creating and supporting numerous environmental, humanitarian and social causes. It explains the evolution of sound on All People, colossal dance beats and dizzying electronic effects taking the fore, as well as a lyrical sincerity that has always had Franti singing about what moves him most.<br> <br> All People is the follow-up to Franti\u2019s wildly successful 2010 release, \u201cThe Sound of Sunshine\u201d, his highest charting album to date. Recorded primarily at his home with guitarist J Bowman, the two recorded some 35 songs before settling on the final track list for All People. For the first time, Franti reached out to collaborate with various writers and producers. <br> <br> \u201cIt was like speed dating,\u201d Franti says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a limited amount of time to write the greatest song you\u2019ve ever heard. But when it works, it\u2019s magic.\u201d<br> <br> The chemistry is evident on collaborations with multi-platinum Australian producer/songwriter Adrian Newman, who co-wrote \u201cLong Ride Home,\u201d \u201cCloser To You,\u201d \u201cSay Goodbye\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Alive (Life Sounds Like)\u201d, as well as with the seven-time Grammy-nominated Canadian production team The Matrix, who produced and co-wrote the tracks \u201c11:59\u201d and \u201cOn and On.\u201d <br> <br> Sam Hollander, another collaborator who has worked with chart-topping acts like Train, One Direction and Katy Perry, came on for the songs \u201cWherever You Are\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Go.\u201d Franti says, \u201cHe also comes from a similar musical experience as I do, growing up when rap, punk and reggae were merging. But he also really knows the pop realm.\u201d<br> <br> Not that Franti has completely left behind the world of the 24-hour news cycle. His outrage can be heard on tracks like \u201c11:59\u201d and \u201cSay Goodbye,\u201d which was inspired by the Trayvon Martin shooting. Instead, Franti has both widened his scope of the world and pulled in closer for his most intimate moments. <br> <br> Many of the love songs on All People are born from his relationship with his partner Sara. \u201cThese songs are about the power of unconditional love, born out of tough times. It\u2019s rare to find someone who accepts you being your own authentic self. In the past I didn\u2019t always give space for the broad spectrum of emotion, but this time I made an effort to write about everything I experience.\u201d<br> <br> More than ever, the songwriter looked to his primary influences for inspiration, referencing the wide range of work by music icons like John Lennon, Bob Marley, Johnny Cash, Marvin Gaye and the Clash. Of the sound on All People Franti says, \u201cMy favorite artists were great at pop form. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed what I do. I just realized I can do it simpler and more direct.\u201d<br> <br> Franti and his band Spearhead are known for the communal spirit they create with their extraordinary live shows. The singer regularly brings down the barrier between the performers on stage and the people in the audience; whether venturing into the crowd to slap hands or pulling fans up to dance, sing and play along with the band. He\u2019s a dynamic performer who effortlessly moves tens of thousands of people with his invocations. Watching him, you can't help but think about how much he delights in every moment.<br> <br> From his beginnings in the post-punk band the Beatings and critically acclaimed hip-hop group Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (who toured with U2 and Public Enemy) Franti has remained a devoted defender of the underdog. <br> <br> For a decade, Franti hosted the Power to the Peaceful free concerts in San Francisco, at first to support incarcerated political activist Mumia Abu Jamal, then as a platform to speak out against escalating violence around the globe. He\u2019s made several trips to hot spots in the Middle East to see war\u2019s human toll with his own eyes. In 2005, he made the film \u201cI Know I\u2019m Not Alone\u201d about his travels through Iraq, Palestine and Israel.<br> <br> \u201cI made a commitment to myself years ago that I wouldn\u2019t just read about what was happening in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed to go and experience it.\u201d<br> <br> It was on these trips that he realized people don\u2019t necessarily want to hear songs that bluntly address the ills of the world but rather songs that will offer them some escape from their difficulties. <br> <br> \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to live in a society where anger is a force that gets things done,\u201d Franti says. \u201cSome people react by throwing a trash can through a window. I\u2019d rather go play music in a school, prison or war zone. Those are the ways I choose to affect change.\u201d<br> <br> The same week his 2009 smash \u201cSay Hey (I Love You)\u201d broke, eventually selling over 2-million downloads, Franti\u2019s appendix ruptured and put him in the hospital close to death. It was another moment that changed his perspective on songwriting, leading to the triumphant tone of All People. <br> <br> \u201cI want to make music that is timeless,\u201d Franti says. \u201cAt this point in my life when I turn on the radio and hear my song it means a lot to me. When I was a kid I would go on these long drives with my family I and still remember the songs we would listen to in the car. It means I\u2019m part of somebody\u2019s life passages.

He knows how it can inspire, uplift and make people want to dance or cry. He felt it firsthand recently when he heard the children\u2019s chorus at New York\u2019s PS22 elementary school singing \u201cI\u2019m Alive (Life Sounds Like),\u201d the celebratory first single from Franti\u2019s tenth studio album, All People. <br> <br> \u201cIt moved me to tears, to hear these kids singing, \u2018Everybody wants me to be who they want me to be.\u2019 That\u2019s who I wrote \u2018People\u2019 for. To let them know, your mission in life should be to be yourself and to embrace the diversity of others.\u201d<br> <br> It\u2019s a rule the barefoot, 6-foot-6 San Francisco based singer-songwriter-guitarist and philanthropist has diligently followed over the past two decades, proactively creating and supporting numerous environmental, humanitarian and social causes. It explains the evolution of sound on All People, colossal dance beats and dizzying electronic effects taking the fore, as well as a lyrical sincerity that has always had Franti singing about what moves him most.<br> <br> All People is the follow-up to Franti\u2019s wildly successful 2010 release, \u201cThe Sound of Sunshine\u201d, his highest charting album to date. Recorded primarily at his home with guitarist J Bowman, the two recorded some 35 songs before settling on the final track list for All People. For the first time, Franti reached out to collaborate with various writers and producers. <br> <br> \u201cIt was like speed dating,\u201d Franti says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a limited amount of time to write the greatest song you\u2019ve ever heard. But when it works, it\u2019s magic.\u201d<br> <br> The chemistry is evident on collaborations with multi-platinum Australian producer/songwriter Adrian Newman, who co-wrote \u201cLong Ride Home,\u201d \u201cCloser To You,\u201d \u201cSay Goodbye\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Alive (Life Sounds Like)\u201d, as well as with the seven-time Grammy-nominated Canadian production team The Matrix, who produced and co-wrote the tracks \u201c11:59\u201d and \u201cOn and On.\u201d <br> <br> Sam Hollander, another collaborator who has worked with chart-topping acts like Train, One Direction and Katy Perry, came on for the songs \u201cWherever You Are\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Go.\u201d Franti says, \u201cHe also comes from a similar musical experience as I do, growing up when rap, punk and reggae were merging. But he also really knows the pop realm.\u201d<br> <br> Not that Franti has completely left behind the world of the 24-hour news cycle. His outrage can be heard on tracks like \u201c11:59\u201d and \u201cSay Goodbye,\u201d which was inspired by the Trayvon Martin shooting. Instead, Franti has both widened his scope of the world and pulled in closer for his most intimate moments. <br> <br> Many of the love songs on All People are born from his relationship with his partner Sara. \u201cThese songs are about the power of unconditional love, born out of tough times. It\u2019s rare to find someone who accepts you being your own authentic self. In the past I didn\u2019t always give space for the broad spectrum of emotion, but this time I made an effort to write about everything I experience.\u201d<br> <br> More than ever, the songwriter looked to his primary influences for inspiration, referencing the wide range of work by music icons like John Lennon, Bob Marley, Johnny Cash, Marvin Gaye and the Clash. Of the sound on All People Franti says, \u201cMy favorite artists were great at pop form. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve changed what I do. I just realized I can do it simpler and more direct.\u201d<br> <br> Franti and his band Spearhead are known for the communal spirit they create with their extraordinary live shows. The singer regularly brings down the barrier between the performers on stage and the people in the audience; whether venturing into the crowd to slap hands or pulling fans up to dance, sing and play along with the band. He\u2019s a dynamic performer who effortlessly moves tens of thousands of people with his invocations. Watching him, you can't help but think about how much he delights in every moment.<br> <br> From his beginnings in the post-punk band the Beatings and critically acclaimed hip-hop group Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy (who toured with U2 and Public Enemy) Franti has remained a devoted defender of the underdog. <br> <br> For a decade, Franti hosted the Power to the Peaceful free concerts in San Francisco, at first to support incarcerated political activist Mumia Abu Jamal, then as a platform to speak out against escalating violence around the globe. He\u2019s made several trips to hot spots in the Middle East to see war\u2019s human toll with his own eyes. In 2005, he made the film \u201cI Know I\u2019m Not Alone\u201d about his travels through Iraq, Palestine and Israel.<br> <br> \u201cI made a commitment to myself years ago that I wouldn\u2019t just read about what was happening in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed to go and experience it.\u201d<br> <br> It was on these trips that he realized people don\u2019t necessarily want to hear songs that bluntly address the ills of the world but rather songs that will offer them some escape from their difficulties. <br> <br> \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to live in a society where anger is a force that gets things done,\u201d Franti says. \u201cSome people react by throwing a trash can through a window. I\u2019d rather go play music in a school, prison or war zone. Those are the ways I choose to affect change.\u201d<br> <br> The same week his 2009 smash \u201cSay Hey (I Love You)\u201d broke, eventually selling over 2-million downloads, Franti\u2019s appendix ruptured and put him in the hospital close to death. It was another moment that changed his perspective on songwriting, leading to the triumphant tone of All People. <br> <br> \u201cI want to make music that is timeless,\u201d Franti says. \u201cAt this point in my life when I turn on the radio and hear my song it means a lot to me. When I was a kid I would go on these long drives with my family I and still remember the songs we would listen to in the car. It means I\u2019m part of somebody\u2019s life passages.

Perhaps their families stopped at the same Maryland welcome center and 9 year old Ben and Suzanne stared at the same bag of cheezits in a vending machine, turned to each other and said \u201c Hey homey, let\u2019s meet up in Los Angeles in ten years and start a folk band that will turn into a folk rock band that will turn into a full throttle rock all the way band.\u201d Either way, the coalescence of HONEYHONEY has been nothing short of a predetermined soul contract amongst two alien hybrids that came here to spread sweet jams, inappropriate stage banter and insightful beliefs and thoughts via the clubs, festivals, theaters, internets, and Joe Rogan podcasts of the world. Their menagerie of sounds covers many traditional genres ranging from blues/rock and folk, to hip hop and jungle cat, which can explain why they\u2019ve toured alongside the diverse likes of Sheryl Crow, James Morrison, Christina Perri, Trampled by Turtles, Xavier Rudd and Jake Bugg. They have a tendency to fit in everywhere from their performances for the bootyshort-wearing throngs of Coachella to the lawnchair-toting masses of the Newport Folk Festival. Their love for the music they create and their friendship in this life are like a sacred egg that continues to be incubated with the utmost tender care. As they are in the middle of recording their third record, the rumors of it\u2019s evolved eargasmic potential have been spreading like a fungus that you won\u2019t want to get rid of. It has been said that you can expect a twist on their previous album releases that brings them to the level known as \u201cballin\u201d. In their passionate endeavor to spread love and joy through their tunes, the now 20 something year old Ben and Suzanne have honored and appreciated their journey of rock thus far and will continue to do so until the mothership calls them home. <strong>8pm doors, 9pm show. $12.

I really did run away from home, if only for a few days, and parts of this song diary come from those honest emotions and true events. But I wanted these songs to flow like good film, like my daydreams do, so I took a storyteller\u2019s liberty here and there. My hope is that this collection is an all-encompassing escape for the listener; a chance to runaway for 45 minutes and get lost in a good story. In tenth grade my friend Becky and I decided on a whim to just split. Our friend Jenny drove us downtown to the Detroit bus station and we went to Chicago. We slept in the big train station where we were approached a number of times by what I\u2019m sure were pimps wondering if we needed \u201cwork.\u201d We definitely looked the part of teenagers ready to find trouble, and after a couple of nights we were caught and taken by paddy wagon to Juvenile Hall and then flown home. It was an adventure, and fortunately it had a safe and happy ending. Not every runaway gets so lucky. In 2009 I was invited to play an opening run for an artist named Seasick Steve. His life story is full of hobo adventure. He ran away at 14, hopped trains, played music and had a million interesting jobs and stories to tell. After recounting some of his vagabond stories I thought how I would have loved to have him guide me through the ways of being a real drifter, had I not been caught in that Chicago train station. His stories made it seem romantic. Knowing Steve, he would have eventually steered me home and so my daydream turned into the song \u201cRabbit.\u201d It opens the record, and I see it as something of a foreshadowing in the storyline. The cover songs stitch together and round out the storyline. \u201cWhere I Lead Me\u201d brings a little fun and defiance to the drifter in our story, when she\u2019s feeling free and empowered and isn\u2019t yet homesick or hungry. \u201cHow\u201d struck me at once as a song always appropriate at some point in just about any story\u2019s plot, and \u201cDark Moon\u201d comes at the moment she\u2019s realizing that there is always a dark side. My filmmaker friend Mike McCarthy wrote \u201cLousy Pretender,\u201d which I tried to include on my last record, Stranger Me, but couldn\u2019t make it fit. It seems to settle better with this collection of songs \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s a bit ambiguous in its literal place in the storyline, but this is where the listener gets to decide who plays the cheating wife. I\u2019m sure now that when taking that trip to Chicago I was really running to something not away from something. My home life wasn\u2019t tragic \u2013 some parts were just sad and unsatisfying. My parents had recently divorced, my sister was angry and in trouble, and school bored me to tears. Most of my friends were lost souls experimenting with drugs (I am not excluded on this one count), skipping class (well, this one too), getting pregnant (thank goodness, not this one) and nothing seemed to be happening. As a matter of fact, I believe all of them stayed near that small Michigan town and now have nice families and regular jobs. At times that life seems desirable, but my nature is too restless. I wouldn\u2019t last. The song \u201cBig Sister\u201d is written from a child\u2019s perspective. When we were young my sister and I fought like animals and I thought she was the meanest thing on Earth. She seemed cruel, sometimes abusive and was a vacuum for my parent\u2019s attention. Today, my sister is amazing. We\u2019re close, and our teenage years are water under the bridge. She\u2019s also an artist \u2013 now that I understand her better, I know she felt things in our childhood with an artist\u2019s sensibilities and was in a lot of pain. \u201cLast Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Boy To Dance\u201d falls in with the theme of a drifter\u2019s restlessness and recognizes the restlessness in another. The Last Rock\u2019N\u2019Roll Boy to Dance is someone behaving in a way that embodies reckless abandon with indifference to the judgments about the common cool kid at any rock club. \u201cSnowflake\u201d is the most honest song here. It\u2019s my perspective, in my language and gives an accurate account of what went through my mind in the act of leaving. It\u2019s kind of like my version of \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d I moved away from home for good at 17. I briefly quit school, later finishing at night school while working at various restaurants. I saved my money and moved to L.A., but I couldn\u2019t find a job \u2013 17 days later I asked my mom to wire me some money to get back to Michigan. I left again at 19 and moved to Louisiana, then Nashville, Ocean City and Orlando. I eventually made it to Memphis, which I now call home \u2013 but I tour more than I\u2019m there, and it satisfies my nature. I wrote \u201cSelf Made Orphan\u201d in the middle of a terrible crush. The desire to be connected to my crush was so powerful that I was sincerely terrified. I was trying to convince myself that I didn\u2019t want to love or to be loved in any kind of needy way. I was so distracted by this man that my brain twisted every song on the radio to be about us. The matters of the heart scare me more than anything, and actually, the entire record was recorded under this duress. Anyway, I gave the song to the character in my daydream. I put her out on a sidewalk with a transistor radio and let her try to convince herself that she was happy with what was around her. Of course, through the writing of the song I knew I was going to have to get brave and take a chance \u2014 run to something \u2014 and I\u2019m so grateful I did. When I was a kid, my mother once said, \u201cYou could drop Amy naked in the middle of New York City with one dollar and she\u2019d walk out clothed with a hundred.\u201d Naturally this is one of my favorite things she ever said about me. I try to buy into it as I roll around the world. At times I am running away from a bad experience and other times racing to what I know will be a good show or a chance to see some friends.

The 8.5 minute track as a two-sided single was # 1 for four weeks and kept the album # 1 for seven weeks - even pulling McLean\u2019s first LP into the charts. \"Vincent/Castles In the Air\" from the same LP was a # 12 hit and played daily in the entrance to the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.<br> <br> His third album, Don McLean in '72 was a number 23 LP and included a top 30 song, \"Dreidel\"; Playin' Favorites in '73 got back to his folk/country roots and included a top-40 UK single \"Everyday.\" Homeless Brother in '74 included \"The Legend of Andrew McCrew,\u201d a true story about a black hobo who died in 1913 and was exhibited in carnivals as a 'petrified man' and not buried until 1973. The two-disc Solo issued in '76 included all the hits and was followed by a switch to Artista for Prime Time in '77. He had hits again on the Millenium label-Chain Lightning in '81 included a # 5 cover of Roy Orbison's hit \"Crying\" and the top 30 hit \"Since I Don't Have You.\" Believers in '82 included a new top 30 version of \"Castles in the Air.\" Dominion in '83 on EMI/UK was a two-disc set made in concert at London's Dominion Theatre.

His musical career has been wide-ranging, interesting and took him to the heights of critical and commercial acclaim in the early 1990s. These days, he\u2019s musically self-reliant and recovering from a serious aneurysm. His formative years were spent listening to the hippy rockers of the 60s such as The Beatles, Bob Dylan and Love, as well as Motown and Merseybeat, all of which have echoes in the funky but folkily-hippy soul pop songs he went on to make. Leaving the public school Charterhouse, Wallinger\u2019s first foray into the music business was in 1976 as a member of the group Quasimodo, who were much later to mutate into The Alarm. He moved to London in the late 1970s to work as a clerk for ATV/Northern Songs music publishing company, but soon he became musical director of the Rocky Horror Show in the West End. 1983 found him joining a funk band called The Out and then The Waterboys as a keyboard player. Tensions between him and Mike Scott in the band were severe, coming to a particular head in 1985. Scott refused to lip-sync on Top Of The Pops, costing them a place on what was then the single most important method of publicising a single. Then Scott over-ruled Wallinger over the inclusion of songs written by each of them about Live Aid and its aftermath. Wallinger left The Waterboys, along with his bandmates Guy Chambers and Chris Witten, in 1986, and worked on what would became World Party\u2019s debut album. Private Revolution was released in 1987, and was a minor hit for Ensign, who\u2019d kept Wallinger on contract after he\u2019d left The Waterboys. <br> Private Revolution was also a minor critical success. Suffice to say although interest was there, it wasn\u2019t a breakthrough. That came with the 1990 album Goodbye Jumbo, released after Wallinger had contributed to Sin\u00c3\u00a9ad O\u2019Connor\u2019s 1988 debut album The Lion And The Cobra. <br> Goodbye Jumbo was commercially successful, spawning the hits Message In The Box and Way Down Now, and becoming the very first Q magazine Album of the Year. The follow-up, Bang!, was another big commercial success, reaching number two in the UK album charts and charting with the singles Is It Like Today and All I Gave. In 1994 he was the musical director for the film Reality Bites and also contributed to the soundtrack of 1996\u2019s Clueless. <br> In 1996 Karl wrote She\u2019s The One, for the film of the same name. Tom Petty, as musical director for the film, decided to perform the soundtrack himself. The song was eventually given to the soundtrack of the film Match Maker, but it was the start of a strange period in Wallinger\u2019s life. <br> Guy Chambers, who was in the band with Wallinger, begun working with EMI artist Robbie Williams, as they tried to develop him as a major solo artist. Williams was a fan of World Party\u2019s Egyptology LP, which featured the song. He recorded the track with Chambers, and the rest of Wallinger\u2019s band, but not to his knowledge. The single went to number one, won a Brit, and its parent album, Escapology, was a massive seller. <br> While the royalties from the Robbie Williams version would prove useful, the farrago was the last straw for Wallinger, who left EMI. He was able to take back the rights to World Party\u2019s back catalogue and jumped to a label called Papillon, run by two former EMI executives. In 2000 Dumbing Up was released by Papillon, but after a short period of touring, disaster struck when Karl suffered an aneurysm. Effectively taking him out of action for two years, it was largely royalties from She\u2019s The One which saw him through. More legal manoeuvring and recuperations took him to 2005, when he decided to take World Party back on the road and into the public consciousness. Operating with his own label, Seaview, he has set about re-releasing his back catalogue in America. <br> Early 2006 saw him playing the South By South West festival in Austin, Texas. He told us, \u201cIt was very heartwarming when people sang material back to me, not only older material but newer. \u201cI\u2019ve been away for so long; it\u2019s a crazy planet and I don\u2019t care [about the industry] anymore. I just want to go out and sing now.\u201d <strong>w/ David Duffy</strong> w/ David Duffy <br> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/David-Duffy/119333727010\" onclick=\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.facebook.com/pages/David-Duffy/119333727010', 'https://www.facebook.com/pages/David-Duffy/119333727010']);\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/David-Duffy/119333727010</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/David-Duffy/119333727010\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/David-Duffy/119333727010</a> <br> David Duffy was born into a musical family in County Mayo, Ireland.

You throw the record on the stereo and the first thing you notice is the energy and force of it: You could use the girl-group bounce of 'Total Serendipity' to help you do some sort of running-and-jumping-up-and-down exercise (that song even comes complete with a couple of cool-down sections). The first response you might have to 'Maracas' is to do the robot dance as the portamento Laser Cats intro kicks in, and that might be the correct response. Go slightly deeper and you find the song-craft. You find that Kori is one of the best female singers in modern music (and Jason is also no slouch). You notice the effortless way their voices harmonize and volley back and forth, the movements within the song, the way they move from upbeat to pastoral so fluidly that you don't perceive it happening. Their instruments and voices all move as one piece, inseparable. Through the years, the textures have become more intricate, deeper. They've begun throwing in the occasional trumpet or guitar, but it is still stunning how much they can do with just keyboards and drums. They move so far within the limitations of the two-piece format that you can't even call it a limitation. It feels as natural as the standard rock-and-roll four-piece. Songs like 'Unless I'm Led' or 'Mistakes' are like a conversation between the two of them as they are going to sleep, when words suddenly come to them, and it is all teetering on the edge of sense. Much has been written about Mates Of State that gloms on to the fact that Jason and Kori are beautiful people in love, with two beautiful daughters. I, too, was once bewitched by their good looks but then I stopped looking at the pin-ups on my wall and started listening to their records. All of the big ideas come to the surface: hope, grief, regret, gratitude, fate, the inevitability of change, the redemption of change, not carrying around the garbage of the past. There is a melancholy to much of their music that is sometimes ignored, and that often marks some of their best moments, like 'Mistakes' and 'Desire'. Switching between the melancholy and buoyantly hopeful is another specialty of theirs, one that they really nail on \"Mountaintops\" -- the perfect family reminding us it is always a struggle to be happy, no matter where you are in life. The album title comes from an old Zen tale where a monk's philosophical advice is to always aim for Cold Mountain, the eye always staying on the mountaintop, reaching it just to see the next mountaintop. You hear that throughout these songs: Kori and Jason traveling hopefully, knowing that the struggle and striving are probably the point of the whole thing. Sometimes it is as clear as the titles, with the three-song punch of 'Desire','Change' and 'Mistakes' that ends the album. The whole thing is so focused that it unfolds like one long piece, like an album should. I know I have to be careful of what I write here, because it may be repeated to Jason and Kori a few hundred times, but I hear a lot of ABBA in their songs. Like ABBA, they write sophisticated boy-girl pop performed so flawlessly that you think it must be easy (but it's not easy). I hear some of the early work of Giorgio Moroder, and I hear some of the more timeless 80s pop, like 'This Is The Day' by The The. I hear some classic Kirsty MacColl in 'Sway'. I hear some of Nick Lowe's effortless appropriation of classic pop forms. Sometimes I hear the Valley Girl soundtrack, one of my all-time favorites, in a song like 'Basement Money.' 'Desire' could have been a big hit for The Carpenters. They touch on so much of what has been great in the last 50 years of pop music, all viewed through the Mates of State filter. Most of all, they have actually built their own sound. They sound like themselves. I hear 'Palomino' and it sounds like quintessential Mates of State. Sometimes I hear a new band and think 'What a Mates Of State rip-off!'

It\u2019s like the air charging with ions before the break of a storm.</p>\n<p>In 1992 in South Florida, just such a storm broke on the music scene with Jack Off Jill. Even in a pre-internet world, their reputation for visceral, shrieking, blood-drenched crazed live shows was radiating like a live circuit across the country, eventually spreading to a worldwide audience of disenchanted, marginalized fans. The swelling crowd embracing Marilyn Manson, the Lunachicks, Lords of Acid, Babes in Toyland, Joan Jett, L7, 7 Year Bitch \u2013 all bands that Jack Off Jill would eventually tour and play with \u2013 were hungry for anti-heroes.</p>\n<p>Despite their nasty, anti-social live reputation, the music industry couldn\u2019t ignore Jack Off Jill\u2019s growing popularity and rabid fan base. Critics praised JOJ as \u201criot-goth legends\u201d (Simon Price, The Independent), and claim \u201cJack Off Jill may not have changed the world, but the listeners who embraced them are still entranced by the band\u2019s high-decibel madness, dark subtleties and brutal ardour.\u201d (Jason Pettigrew, Alternative Press)</p>\n<p>Over the next eight years, the band would go on to release two studio albums including \u201cClear Hearts, Grey Flowers\u201d with cover art by Los Angeles fine artist Mark Ryden, two independent recordings, a remix LP, and a compilation record.</p>\n<p>Fifteen years have passed since the dissolution of Jack Off Jill, but what the band created in those eight years they were together is still just as powerful now as before. Their original fans, with their blacked out lips and buckle boots, have been joined by a whole new wave of disaffected youth not even born during those riotous times. Together, they\u2019ve kept the Jack Off Jill torch burning, always hoping for a day when the women would return to the stage.</p>\n<p>And that day is now upon us.</p>\n<p>On <span data-term=\"goog_488170851\">Saturday, July 18th 2015</span>, original Jack Off Jill members Jessicka Addams (vocals), Tenni AhCha Cha (drums), and Michelle Inhell (guitar) will be joined by bassist Helen Storer (Fluffy, Thee heavenly Music Association) to play one U.S. show only at The Orange Peel in Asheville, North Carolina.</p>\n<p>They will be joined by opening acts JD Samson (Le Tigre, MEN) and Minneapolis\u2019s feminist punk trio Kitten Forever.

Produced by the band and Grizzly Bear\u2019s Chris Taylor, Highlights began in a basement in Pittsburgh and ended in a church in Brooklyn. It trades world music sounds (as heard through YouTube) for a more alive, realized approach, the result of Emm and Cohen wanting to break from their \u2018two guys, one screen\u2019 writing style. The transition came suddenly: when they sat down to write Highlights in Emm\u2019s childhood home in Pittsburgh, their computer blew up, quite literally, \u201cwith a burst of sparks and clouds of smoke. Whatever had just happened felt like some kind of omen,\u201d says Emm. Stranded without the samples and sounds that had previously defined their musical palette, they spent the rest of the week in Pittsburgh writing songs the old-fashioned way -- with a guitar and drums. They found themselves falling back on facility they\u2019d gained with their instruments over the previous two years of touring, and an alternative, simpler process evolved, one that set the tone for Highlights immediately. Influenced by their time spent on the road touring Mixed Emotions, primarily in the States, they reached for the sounds of 90\u2019s New York hip-hop drums, Detroit techno synths, and lots and lots of guitars. The results of which would lead them to call this their 'American album\u2019, \u201cthough it may only sound that way to us,\u201d says Emm. Instead, let\u2019s just call Highlights \u201cthe album where things started making more sense.\u201d Whereas before the band had wandered their way through foreign musical landscapes and the existential \u2018what am I doing with my life\u2019 wasteland of post-youth, Highlights finds the band settled and at home, comfortable in their own skin. Indeed, one listen to Highlights shows this change in subject matter has brought Tanlines to a more evolved, sophisticated place. Themes of love and desire replace questions of the unknown. Partnerships are celebrated while relationships grow and change and give way to safe-distance reflections on the past without the trappings of nostalgia. Between working in Los Angeles with producer Patrick Ford, and their hometown of New York City with Chris Taylor, they eventually settled on the ten songs that make up the album. Taylor brought them to record in a 100 year-old church; the unfamiliar settings and Taylor's energy and enthusiasm pushed the band to new heights. Most noticeable are Emm\u2019s powerful vocals, broadcast from the balcony of the empty church, and thankfully, captured warmly and beautifully by Taylor across the whole album. In many ways, the resulting music feels like a renaissance for a band that began in 2008 as a one-off remix project. The upbeat dancefloor-ready Tanlines lives on in songs like driving set opener \u201cPieces\u201d, the dream-inspired \u201cSlipping Away\u201d, and the seductive \u201cBad Situations\u201d, but the colors and emotional range of the album go much deeper than ever before, with Emm's vocals and lyrics, at once personal and observational, taking center stage on songs like \u201cRunning Still\u201d and \u201cInvisible Ways.\u201d</p>\n"},{"node_title":"Phish N\u2019 Chips \u2013 FREE SHOW","image_imported":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/uWsv84YRavJ95oOKHv9dxxIZG1WiHvN1ofZ1oy66rdc/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-2475_27.jpg?itok=3WYuS6_q\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/lPLeysSsf7d4P5q6dzdfQNVCPTbW_tJhaw2ieSqTIvM/mtime:1420842907/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_venue_show/public/event-2475_210.jpg?itok=fhYo9kMM\" width=\"360\" height=\"320\" />","date":"2015-07-23 00:00:00","ticket price":null,"tickets":null,"nid":"18695","path":"/show/phish-n%E2%80%99-chips-%E2%80%93-free-show-70","date_group":"2015-07-23 00:00:00","venue":"7328","body":"<p><br>\n<p>Phish N\u2019 Chips<br> every Thursday from 6pm-9pm<br> FREE ALL AGES</p>\n<p>Live Phish Tunes by<br> THE DUKES OF LIZARDS<br> feat.

Dockery\u2019s performances are dynamic, fast-paced, quirky, and hilarious. In Wanderlust: From Here to Timbuktu, Dockery acts out his winsome odyssey of dropping everything after ten years of temporary work, buying a one-way ticket to an unknown land, and believing that fate will necessarily reward him with an epiphany, any epiphany at all. In unscripted stories that range from comical to solemn, from poignant to absurd, Wanderlust spins multiple narrative threads all at once illustrating many basic, beautiful, uplifting human truths. With enormous energy, immediacy, and physicality, Dockery\u2019s enchanting tales become imaginatively picturesque and vicariously vivid. <b><i>These performances are in The Forum.</i></b> <b><a class=\"external-link\" href=\"http://mountainx.com/arts/one-man-show-wanderlust-thinks-globally-acts-personally/\">Read the interview with Martin Dockery</a> in this week's <i>Mountain Xpress</i>.<i><br></i></b> <b>The show is a special event in conjunction with the 2015 Asheville Fringe Arts Festival. $2 discount available for Freak Pass holders.
