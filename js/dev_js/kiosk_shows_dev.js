An evening of the music that I grew up listening to and also grew up singing (Jazz, Standards, Country, Rock &amp; Roll, Rhythm &amp; Blues, Doo Wop and Gospel). Along with Russ will be Hank Bones on Guitar, Mike Filippone on Bass, Tony Creasman on Drums and a few very special guests. SEE A VIDEO: RUSS WILSON \u2013 Singer, Drummer, Conductor, Entrepreneur. For almost 30 years Russ has worked as a professional musician and has made a name for himself playing many different styles of music including Rock &amp; Roll, Country, Gospel, Blues, R&amp;B, Dixieland, Big Band Swing, Bebop, pit work for Broadway style shows and Symphonic music. Of all these Jazz remains his first true love. He\u2019s had the gracious opportunity to share the stage with quite a few famous musicians during that time. For example: Jimmy Thackery (The Nighthawks and The Drivers) Kim Wilson (Fabulous Thunderbirds) Mookie Brill (world renown singer and musician) Hubert Sumlin (Howlin\u2019 Wolf\u2019s guitarist for 25 years) Chicago Bob Nelson (The Heartfixers) Jerry \u201cBoogie\u201d McCain (She\u2019s Tough!) Charlie Musselwhite (world famous Harmonica player) Calvin \u201cFuzz\u201d Jones (Bass player for Muddy Waters &amp; Howlin\u2019 Wolf) David Johansen (New York Dolls) Levon Helm (THE BAND) Carey Bell (world famous harmonica player) Skeeter Brandon (Hwy 61) Chris Thomas King (Oh Brother Where Art Thou) Dave Maxwell (pianist with Freddie King) Bob Margolin (guitarist for Muddy Waters) Just to name a few (wink~wink). Since 1989 Russ has played drums and vocalized on 31 albums ~ 8 of those being his own projects. After touring and traveling for many years playing with various blues bands Russ decided to start one of his own. With the help of his good friend and guitarist Marc Brookshire they formed THE MIGHTY MIGHTY MEN in 2001. In late 2003 he started his second musical organization called THE NOUVEAU-PASSE ORCHESTRA playing the music that he grew up listening to, vintage jazz and dance band music of the 20\u2019s and 30\u2019s. The orchestra ranges in size from 14 pieces to a 35 piece concert orchestra. Then, if that weren\u2019t enough, he formed a smaller version of the NPO called THE RUSS WILSON SWINGTETTE. He is also co-leader of a quartet called THE SWINGTONES and, most recently, has started a new band playing Rockabilly and Honky Tonk Country called THE ASHEVEGAS PLAYBOYS and if THAT weren\u2019t enough he is also percussionist/vocalist for the Hawaiian/Exotica group called KON TIKI, WENDY HAYES, HEATHER MASTERTON and the world renown FIRECRACKER JAZZ BAND. Somehow he still finds time to freelance for such luminaries as guitarists ARMAND LENCHEK and WILL McFARLAND and swing band leader GEORGE KNOTT and THE ATOMIC RHYTHM ALLSTARS. In 2007 Russ made his premier as conductor with his orchestra performing George Gershwin\u2019s RHAPSODY IN BLUE. Since then he has directed numerous concerts and shows. Of those most notably THE \u201cPOPS\u201d CONCERT (the music of the King of Jazz, Paul Whiteman) and his annual ART DECO REVUE. In September of 2008 he took a break from band leading to tour with JIMMY THACKERY AND THE DRIVERS. With that tour of duty ending in December 2010 Russ went back to being a band leader and running his own businesses, THE WILSON MUSIC COMPANY and WONDERTONE RECORDS putting all of his musical aggregations under one roof and one label.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"The First Songsmith Showcase ft.

The project originated with the intention of creating country music demos but ended up as an 8-piece band with a full length album and a follow up scheduled for release in 2015. With minimal marketing or publicity, an ever-growing fan base quickly developed. Within weeks, their music received air play on local radio, a live band was assembled, and some of their songs were licensed through Nicki Jack Publishing. Raising Caine has been playing established venues in the Asheville, NC area including Isis Music Hall, the Grey Eagle Tavern, and the New Earth Music Hall as well as festivals such as Bonnaroo, Mountain Sports Fest, &amp; Appalachian Shakedown. The project is poised for a bright future. Raising Caine is laying a solid musical foundation while building a network of friends and fans. Thanks for checking them out and enjoy the music! SEE A VIDEO: She\u2019s a Hair Tossin\u2019, Cello Wielding Sultry Songstress\u2026 Taking her background as a classically trained cellist and flipping the script a bit, Sarah brings an infectious energy rarely seen by typical singer-songwriters. Armed to the teeth with a honeyed voice, a cello and bow, and a sharp wit, Sarah began owning stages years ago before finally recording her debut full-length solo album in 2013 with Grammy nominated producer and Americana livewire David Mayfield. The result is a gorgeous collection of Americana-tinged songs that touch on pop, jazz, rock, and folk influences. Often fans compare Sarah to the stylings of such great artists as Rickie Lee Jones, Norah Jones, Regina Spektor, Frank Zappa and Lady Gaga. \u201cSarah is full of surprises. Her demeanor is demure, her music is dark-edged with a satirical bite. She has imagination, bravado and the technical chops to turn you into a believer.\u201d Peter Himmelman Born in the soul-basted countryside of Alabama, and brought to the heart of the Blue Ridge mountains to marinade and mature.

For the 2012 full-length debut, \u201cBarefoot,\u201d McElvy teams with resophonic guitar guru, Billy Cardine, as creative consultant and coproducer. The album features collaborations with decorated pros, such as; Keller Williams, Larry and Jenny Keel, and Tim carbone of Rail Road Earth. \u201cBarefoot\u201d received stellar reviews and accolades from industry peers, and listeners alike. The title track earned a spot on Relix Magazine\u2019s widely distributed July-August 2012 compilation disc. For the 2014 EP, \u201cChilly,\u201d McElvy and Cardine again pair in production, recruiting the talents of world class violinst, Casey Driessen, and beat master Jeff Sipe for backing elements. \u201cChilly\u201d delivers nothing short of pure musical gold.

Their music combines elements of old country, rock-a-billy, bluegrass, gospel, and even a little touch of classic rock \u2018n roll. Lisa Love of Georgia Music Magazine and the Georgia Music Foundation describes the band by saying, \u201cWhen you have a group of women who are natural story-tellers, who sooth their aggressive musical chops with beautiful harmonies, temper their rock-n-roll sensibilities with an understanding of Appalachian tradition, and come off as a little bit Keith Richards, a little bit Bill Monroe, you get Roxie Watson.\u201d The group formed in 2007 as a just-for-kicks opportunity for long time friends Beth Wheeler, Lenny Lasater, Linda Bolley, Sonia Tetlow and Becky Shaw to get together and play songs they loved. But what started out as just porch settin\u2019 and cover song playing evolved organically over the years, through the word-of-mouth support of an ever-growing group of loyal fans, into one of the finest original bands in the Southeast, regularly selling out storied songwriting venues from Eddie\u2019s Attic in Decatur, GA to the Bluebird Cafe in Nashville, TN. Each band member takes turns with the lead vocal and contributes to both song and arrangement ideas. From the firecracker guitar playing of Bolley to the delicate mandolin of Wheeler, the propulsive bass of Lasater to the banjo poetry of Tetlow, the lap steel and button box swells to the harp and guitar rhythms of Shaw, Roxie Watson weaves a rich sound. Georgianne Nienaber of the Huffington Post summed up the essence of Roxie Watson when she wrote, \u201cThese women are more than proficient as musicians, have a warm way with a story, and a natural stage banter that comes from a long history of friendship and community. The stage morphs into a back porch, with the audience becoming honored guests in an intimate setting that is a heck of a lot of fun, heartwarming, and heart-rending when it needs to be.\u201d</p>\n"},{"node_title":"An Evening with Reasonably Priced Babies \u2013 [Asheville improv comedy] w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","date":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2015-04-09T00:00:00-04:00\">Thursday, April 09</span>","path":"http://www.ashevillemusicguide.com/show/evening-reasonably-priced-babies-%E2%80%93-asheville-improv-comedy-w-contact-us-26","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/j-RuFr7d_bu2MEnzUUQ5qy-gFvPlzbPqln1yKc3tg7s/mtime:1427987790/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_show/public/RPB_7.jpg?itok=_YrKxRrV\" width=\"1080\" height=\"500\" />","body":"<p>: Thursday April 16, 2015 : 8pm | : 9pm : improv comedy : 18+ : seated, first come first serve $10 Improv Comedy of Western North Carolina and called into being by the Universal Mind to spread joy, odd noises and viral goofiness for the betterment of man.

That\u2019s where Cissokho, a griot born to a family of professional musicians in Senegal, makes his transplanted home. The repertoire is pure Manding, the centuries-old musical culture of Cissokho\u2019s ancestors. It\u2019s reformulated with modernizing impulses in a rock band format: Agile basslines interweave with the melodic twins of kora and electric guitar, undergirded by an explosive rhythm section of djembe and trapset drums. Kora master Cissokho is also the group\u2019s vocal frontman. His electrifying voice propels songs old and new about timeless themes of mythology, migration and universal love. In fact, \u201cuniversal love\u201d is a rough translation of \u201cKaira Ba,\u201d a promise the band communicates live. The kora itself, a jumbo spike-lute with skin-and-gourd resonator, is handed down within families in West Africa. There, it represents a hereditary musical tradition of moral and spiritual gravitas. Cissokho maintains this heritage while walking his own path, playing with youthful fire and acrobatic effect. His North Carolina collaborators\u2014Will Ridenour, Austin McCall, John Westmoreland and Jonathan Henderson\u2014are diversely trained musicians who share a longtime love of African and African-based music. As a result, Kaira Ba has enjoyed a meteoric rise in its first two years of existence. In 2012, the band recorded Resonance, a shimmering studio album that captures all the drive and intensity of its live performances. The band has quickly become a hot ticket at festivals, museums and music venues across the Eastern U.S., touring as far afield as New York City and Senegal. Wherever they play, Diali Cissokho &amp; Kaira Ba summon audiences to the dancefloor with a bonanza of euphoric West African grooves, all inflected with funk, soul, rock and music of the Black Diaspora\u201d. \u2013 Sylvia Pfeiffenberger Arouna Diarra: A griot from the Mandingue culture of West Africa, Arouna Diarra is an accomplished n\u2019goni &amp; balafon player. Performing a tradition of folk songs reflecting topics from war to love for one another, Arouna sings with spirit, nostalgia, and great joy, in his native language, Bambara. Arouna was born in Bobo-Dioulasso, the cultural capital of Burkina Faso. Diarra is a family name associated with the griot. In West African culture, griots are curators of the arts and of history. Their families, like Arouna\u2019s, are composed of musicians, poets, and storytellers. Arouna was destined to bring traditional music into the modern day, further developing it while remaining true to it\u2019s roots. Performing styles such as Wassalou, Arouna brings a dynamic repertoire to the table, full of timing changes and improvisational prowess. He plays the kamel n\u2019goni \u2013 a 14-string harp-like instrument \u2013 with a melodic and percussive sensibility. In fact, Arouna makes his instruments himself, both for performing and for teaching his students. Before making his home in Asheville, North Carolina, Arouna was a key member of internationally-touring group, Lanaya. He is a founding member of NC-based, West African folk music ensemble, Mande Foly.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"THE GREY EAGLE PRESENTS: World Party w/ David Duffy w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","date":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2015-04-09T00:00:00-04:00\">Thursday, April 09</span>","path":"http://www.ashevillemusicguide.com/show/grey-eagle-presents-world-party-w-david-duffy-w-contact-us-28","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn3.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/7U18pWpFt7IBH6hOwhtWhG6IbBV5alVpgL7oZVSd6eU/mtime:1428539468/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_show/public/World_5.jpg?itok=Cn1qmb7H\" width=\"1080\" height=\"500\" />","body":"<p>: Monday July 6, 2015 : 7:00pm | : 8pm : British pop/alternative rock : All Ages! : seated, first come first serve $17 adv. / $20 d.o.s.

Between World Party\u2019s first and second albums, Wallinger aided Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor in recording her 1988 debut, The Lion and the Cobra. O\u2019Connor, then an unknown, had appeared as a guest on World Party\u2019s first album. She would go on to appear as a guest on the second LP as well. Goodbye Jumbo, World Party\u2019s second album, contained the minor UK hit singles \u201cWay Down Now\u201d and \u201cPut the Message in the Box\u201d.Goodbye Jumbo was voted \u201calbum of the year\u201d by Q magazine and was nominated for a Grammy Award for \u201cbest alternative music performance\u201d in the US. After the 1991 EP Thank You World (including a cover of The Beatles\u2019 \u201cHappiness Is a Warm Gun\u201d), Wallinger recruited guitarist David Catlin-Birch and ex-Icicle Works drummer Chris Sharrock as fully-fledged members for 1993\u2019s hit album Bang!. It reached no. 2 in the UK Albums Chart, with the track \u201cIs It Like Today?\u201d (no. 19 on the UK Singles Chart)[1] also becoming a moderately successful single in Europe. The success of Bang! saw World Party in the line-up for the Glastonbury Festival. In 1994, Wallinger did the soundtrack to the film Reality Bites, his first foray into filmscore work. Their fourth album, Egyptology (1997), included \u201cShe\u2019s the One\u201d which was subsequently recorded by Robbie Williams. Wallinger took a three-year break from World Party, before the release of Dumbing Up in 2000. However, in February 2001 he was struck down by an aneurysm that left him with no right hand vision in both eyes. After a long, five-year rehabilitation, in 2006 Wallinger re-emerged onto the scene. With his back catalogue reclaimed from EMI, a distribution deal was struck (via his own Seaview label) with Universal, and he played his first live show in a decade at the Austin, Texas-based South by Southwest festival. He played additional US dates in 2006. Big Blue Ball, a joint project with Peter Gabriel with production work by Stephen Hague (Pet Shop Boys, New Order) has also been released. In September 2007, World Party supported Steely Dan in both bands\u2019 first tour of Australia. In 2011 the band returned to the South by Southwest festival to play a free concert. In 2012 World Party released a new five CD collection of new songs, live recordings and cover versions. Titled \u201cArkeology\u201d. They played The Royal Albert Hall on November 1st 2012.

There\u2019s a hallowed hall, deep within the recesses of the heart, where an amazing truth resides: The power in your life can only be experienced when broken open and shared with the people who come into it. Back in 2005, Mike Farris cracked open the hallway door when, for the first time since the age of 15, he was clean and sober. Recording what would become the critically acclaimed Salvation in Lights (2007), a resurrected Mike eagerly anticipated the future. But with two ruptured discs, back surgery and the death of his beloved manager Rose McGathy all within a few weeks of the record\u2019s release, a rolling fog settled in. And with it, denial. Nevertheless, Mike\u2019s career was picking up steam. He won an Americana Music Award for New/Emerging Artist in 2008, followed by a Dove Award in 2010. His live performances at Bonnaroo, SxSW, Hardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival, and others-were drawing rave reviews. Revered artists like Rodney Crowell, Buddy Miller, Patty Griffin, and Marty Stuart were struck by his incomparable voice, and Mike opened shows for Patti LaBelle, Mavis Staples, Blind Boys of Alabama, Ricky Skaggs and Bruce Hornsby. By 2010, having released the award winning SHOUT! Live followed by an EP for Nashville flood relief efforts, Mike launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund his next record, an independent release. His fans generously funded the project. Serious invitations kept coming: first, to the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame\u2019s 16th Annual American Music Masters concert honoring Aretha Franklin, then TEDx Nashville, and then to the inaugural Austin City Limits Hall of Fame with Double Trouble. Mike\u2019s spirited, soul-gospel fusion had found an enthusiastic audience, but denial has a way of biting back. Compared to his former life, he thought he was fine, but truth be told, Mike had become addicted to pain medication. The new album would have to take a back seat to a gut-check, life-changing recovery. Mike went to rehab and finally began excavating the root causes of his addiction with the help of support groups at AA and NA. An isolator by nature, he struggled laying all his burdens on the table to complete strangers, but gained encouragement through the stories of others. Each honest step led to fertile, hopeful ground. What eventually emerged from that fertile ground is Shine For All The People, the evolution of true sobriety, of finding a new identity as a servant, first as a man but also as an artist. \u201cI\u2019d been working on the record before my recovery, and then there was a pretty huge delay,\u201d explains Mike, who recently signed with Compass Records. \u201cI had to back up, take time to grab the ground, to re-acclimate, to learn how to live now, truly sober for the first time since I was a kid.\u201d This new normal included getting back to the process of creating new music, but there was a distinctive trajectory shift in Mike. \u201cSo many avenues of music flow through me, 100s of years of music, the music that I grew up with-from Blues, Rock, R&amp;B and gospel-there had always been this pressure to try to force it into a box that would sell somehow. It\u2019s crazy and overwhelming at times, the weight of trying to meet expectations and make a living, but this time, that all fell away. I know now that this gift only exists to encourage people in their struggles, and if there\u2019s any power in it, it\u2019s not from me.\u201d Set for release in September 2014, Shine For All The People pushes beyond Salvation in Lights in that it reveals hope not in any glory to come, but in the failures and suffering of the present. \u201cMy music has always been first and foremost for the downtrodden, the wayward\u2026people who\u2019ve had to go up the rough side of the mountain. Even when it\u2019s upbeat and inspiring, there\u2019s always been an element of pain, because truth be told, we\u2019re all flawed. Not everybody knows it, but we all are.\u201d From the opening Cuban/St. Louis blues horns of \u201cRiver Jordan,\u201d originally written and performed by Blind Willie McTell, to the divine salvation of J.B. Lenoir\u2019s \u201cJonah &amp; the Whale,\u201d to the determined stance of the Rev. C.J. Johnson\u2019s \u201cSomething Keeps on Telling Me,\u201d a chorus/mantra that Mike fleshed out into a song in the months after rehab\u2026one listen, and it\u2019s clear there\u2019s something mystical in the waters here. \u201cWhen I first heard the Rev. C.J. Johnson\u2019s version, I could feel the air in that church get still, no music, only the sound of feet on the floor and hands in the air,\u201d Mike says. \u201cI got such strength from it, I knew I wanted to add part of my story. With his words as the chorus, and with Brigitte DeMeyer helping me out, the song serves as a compass for anyone who has lost their way.\u201d Mary Gauthier\u2019s soul-stirring \u201cMercy Now,\u201d one of the first songs Mike chose for the record, is clearly foundational to the whole. \u201cThe song just mystically appeared before me a few months before my Dad was diagnosed with lung cancer,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only did it play a major role in just helping me deal with the year that followed, including his death, but brought comfort to my entire family.\u201d Like other choice cuts on Shine For All The People, the songs simply arrived at the appointed time, Mike says. \u201cThere was a time when I carried all the songwriting on my shoulders, but then the ego gets in the way of what it should be. These days, I don\u2019t have to write everything. I just open the door and these songs show up\u2026songs I need to hear in my struggle, songs I know people need to hear in theirs.\u201d Whether rearranging songs of centuries past or infusing new lyrical life to half-songs, it becomes clear that Mike\u2019s vocal gift is simply the surface of a very deep well. Full-tilt originals include \u201cReal Fine Day,\u201d a poetic account of the birth of Christian Blue Sky Farris that features some killer Kenny Vaughn guitar hooks-\u201ceasily one of the top three days of my life, that day,\u201d Mike says, and \u201cPower of Love,\u201d an unforgettable, high-energy soul groove and already an audience favorite. Shine For All the People bears witness to the determination of putting one foot in front of the other and to the power of music to get you there. \u201cI\u2019ve discovered that falling is a divine thing,\u201d Mike adds. \u201cIt\u2019s part and parcel of being human. The important thing is to keep the faith and keep moving on and on. Daring to be courageous enough to share our deepest burdens with each other is the greatest gift we can give.\u201d Discography Goodnight Sun (2002) Independent Salvation In Lights (2007) INO/Columbia Records SHOUT!

Nothing you read and nothing you hear from her albums prepares you for how entertaining a performer she is. If you\u2019re not already familiar with Cheryl, you have probably heard her music. She is very respected as a songwriter by her peers, which can be seen by how many of them record her songs. Cheryl\u2019s songs have been covered by artists as diverse as Dan Seals, Peter Paul &amp; Mary, Kenny Loggins, Garth Brooks, Suzy Bogguss, Melanie, Bette Midler, Maura O\u2019Connell, Sylvia, Kathy Mattea, and Holly Near. From her albums you can tell that she is a gifted songwriter with a beautiful voice. From other people\u2019s comments about her you learn that she is a natural storyteller with a fantastic sense of humor. But until you see her in person, you never really believe what you\u2019ve been told about her. Interestingly enough, almost half of the songs she performs during her shows have never been recorded! Cheryl\u2019s first concert was to a captive audience. She found an old toy ukelele in a neighbor\u2019s attic and serenaded her mother who was taking a bath at the time. A year later she got a real ukelele, followed by her first guitar. She learned guitar from a neighbor, who also taught a group of boys. Each week they would get together and play just about any song they could think of for hours on end. Her first public performance was at a Hootenanny when she was 12. She started writing her own songs when she was 17. Cheryl has never had a \u201cday job,\u201d and her first professional gigs were at the Steak and Ale Restaurant in her home town of Timonium, Maryland. The place only had one PA system; in the middle of her songs you would hear: \u201cJones, party of four \u2026Jones, party of four.\u201d She finally convinced them to get a second PA system. She performed at venues around Baltimore and Washington DC before moving to New England in 1976, where she now lives. She tours extensively, often performing solo or with Kenny White, who often opens her shows as well. She appeared as part of the On a Winter\u2019s Night tour, and was part of the Philo 25th Anniversary tour. Her funny stories between songs reveal her talent for diversity. Each time she tells a story, it will be a little bit different, so even if you\u2019ve heard it before, you still find yourself laughing.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"The Grey Eagle Presents: BOMBADIL + DARLINGSIDE w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","date":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2015-04-09T00:00:00-04:00\">Thursday, April 09</span>","path":"http://www.ashevillemusicguide.com/show/grey-eagle-presents-bombadil-darlingside-w-contact-us-28","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","image":null,"body":"<p>: Thursday April 23, 2015 : 6pm | : 7pm : indie folk/rock/pop : All Ages! : seated, first come first serve $10 adv. / $12 d.o.s. *****While still a Grey Eagle presentation, THIS SHOW HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE ALTAMONT THEATER located at 18 Church St in downtown Asheville.

BOMBADIL Quirky, multi-textured, wildly inventive, eclectic, and hugely enjoyable,\u201d \u201c\u2026a combination of open-minded chamber folk and the bright and sunny pop music of the 1960s,\u201d \u201cSyd Barrett meets The Beatles,\u201d are just some of the media accolades used to describe Bombadil, a band that over the past year or so has been building a steady buzz, catching the attention and supp Managed by the same team that steers the career of The Avett Brothers, the North Carolina-based Bombadil \u2013 Daniel Michalak (bass, piano, harmonica, vocals), James Phillips (drums, bass, vocals), and Stuart Robinson (piano, ukulele, vocals) \u2013 produced and recorded their new album, Hold On (March 24, 2015/Ramseur Records) over a nine-month period in 2014, scheduling the sessions into the spare moments between tour dates. The album is an amalgamation of rapturous harmonies, sparkling instrumentals, poignant songwriting, and layers of imaginative arrangements that show off the band\u2019s folk roots, but with traces of funk, country, rap, R&amp;B, and New Wave-inspired dance beats. Hold On is an album that surveys the terrain of love with songs full of hope and ironic humor. All three members wrote and sing songs on Hold On, which allowed each to bring his own personality to the mix. \u201cEach of us has different styles so combining them gives us a unique sound,\u201d said Michalak. \u201cI get a lot of my inspiration from books and authors like Ernest Hemingway, Ronald Dahl, or Shel Silverstein\u2026James and Stuart get their inspiration from music, science/math, and computer programming.\u201d Dolph Ramseur, head of Ramseur Records/Management, discovered Bombadil on the band\u2019s MySpace page, caught their live show and signed them in 2006. He helped the group book tours and release records, including the Bombadil EP in 2006, A Buzz, A Buzz in 2008 and Tarpits and Canyonlands in 2009, the record that has often been referred to as \u201cthe album that should have made [Bombadil] famous.\u201d Just prior to its release, Michalak was diagnosed with neural tension, and consequently Bombadil could not tour or promote the record. Bombadil took a hiatus, and after several years of therapy, Michalak was able to return. The band regrouped in North Carolina for 2013\u2019s Metrics of Affection, a release that again received great reviews: \u201cIt\u2019s tough to be truly original while still creating catchy pop tunes, and this band manages to do just that\u2026\u201d \u201cBombadil exerts a natural magic for telling tall tales with a splendid tendency towards casual detail.\u201d After an 18 month period of intense touring and songwriting, Bombadil has crafted a record packed with unforgettable melodies, imaginative sonic landscapes, and irresistible harmonies, making Hold On an early highlight of 2015. DARLINGSIDE The Boston based quartet features four distinct voices clustered around a single microphone; their tightly-arranged tunes drawing from the unexpected, including strains of bluegrass, classical, and even barbershop. Accompanied by an arsenal of classical strings, guitars, mandolin, and percussion, these four close friends swap instruments from song to song and offer a sound that defies standard genre classifications. Darlingside\u2019s collaborative work with fellow Massachusetts native Heather Maloney, which culminated in the 2014 Signature Sounds release \u201cWoodstock,\u201d garnered attention from both The New York Times and The Boston Globe.</p>\n"},{"node_title":"An Evening With comedian Mqueen + special guests TBA w/ Contact Us","image_imported":"","date":"<span class=\"date-display-single\" property=\"dc:date\" datatype=\"xsd:dateTime\" content=\"2015-04-09T00:00:00-04:00\">Thursday, April 09</span>","path":"http://www.ashevillemusicguide.com/show/evening-comedian-mqueen-special-guests-tba-w-contact-us-19","ticket price":null,"tickets":"http://www.etix.com/ticket/online/venueSearch.jsp?venue_id=7410&performance_id=1707516&language=en&country=US","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://cdn2.ashevillemusicguide.com/cdn/farfuture/OrexFosu7LXe6n1BaS7gKChdVsHdRatXyQN478lxnD8/mtime:1428543158/sites/default/files/styles/kiosk_show/public/mcqueen_20.jpg?itok=DQ6Vrmsy\" width=\"1080\" height=\"500\" />","body":"<p>: Thursday May 21, 2015 : 8pm | : 9pm : Comedy : 18+ : seated, first come first serve $10 : \u201cThis show is mad funny!
